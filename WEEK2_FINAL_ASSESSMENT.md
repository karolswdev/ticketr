   - Error handling in place

### Critical Issues

#### BLOCKER: None identified

#### HIGH PRIORITY (Must fix during Week 3)

1. **H1: Missing Component Tests**
   - **Impact:** Reduces confidence in stability
   - **Files affected:**
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/components/modal/`
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/components/actionbar/`
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/layout/`
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/theme/`
   - **Recommendation:** Add unit tests for all components in Week 3 Day 1

2. **H2: Root Model and Update Logic Untested**
   - **Impact:** Core application flow untested
   - **Files affected:**
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/model.go`
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/update.go`
     - `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/tui-bubbletea/view.go`
   - **Recommendation:** Integration tests for full user flows (teatest)

3. **H3: Data Loading Not Fully Implemented**
   - **Impact:** Cannot load real workspace/ticket data yet
   - **Evidence:** Init() only returns component initialization, no data fetch commands
   - **Recommendation:** Implement LoadWorkspaces and LoadTickets commands

#### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Should fix by Week 4)

1. **M1: Code Organization**
   - Some components in both `/components/` and `/components/<name>/` directories
   - Inconsistent file structure (actionbar.go vs actionbar/actionbar.go)
   - **Recommendation:** Standardize on directory-per-component structure

2. **M2: Documentation Gaps**
   - README still references Week 1 POC status
   - Missing architecture decision records for Week 2 choices
   - **Recommendation:** Update docs in Week 3

3. **M3: Theme System Incomplete**
   - Only 3 themes, but no theme switching tests
   - No persistent theme selection
   - **Recommendation:** Add theme persistence and tests in Week 3

#### LOW PRIORITY (Nice-to-have)

1. **L1: Performance Profiling**
   - No pprof integration yet
   - No render time benchmarks
   - **Recommendation:** Add in Week 4 (Phase 3)

2. **L2: Accessibility Features**
   - No screen reader testing
   - No high-contrast mode
   - **Recommendation:** Defer to Phase 5 (Polish)

   - Message passing keeps state predictable
   - No "callback hell" like in imperative UIs

2. **Lipgloss is Powerful**
   - Border management still tricky (width calculations)
   - Adaptive colors work great for light/dark terminals
   - JoinVertical/JoinHorizontal are workhorses

3. **Testing is Straightforward**
   - Pure functions are easy to test
   - teatest library (not yet used) will help with integration tests
   - Golden file testing possible for view snapshots

### Process Improvements for Week 3

1. **Write Tests First**

   - Saves debugging time later
   - Forces better API design

2. **Incremental Integration**
   - Don't wait until end of week to wire components
   - Integrate daily to catch issues early

3. **Document Decisions**
   - ADRs for major architectural choices
   - Helps future contributors understand "why"

### Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't Defer Testing**
   - Week 2 has some untested code paths
   - Harder to add tests later
   - **Action:** Test as you go in Week 3

2. **Watch Border Math**
   - Lipgloss borders add to width/height
   - Easy to get off-by-one errors
   - **Action:** Create helper functions for sizing

3. **Message Type Explosion**
   - Easy to create too many message types
   - Harder to maintain
   - **Action:** Use discriminated unions where possible

## Go/No-Go Decision

### ✅ APPROVE WEEK 3 - PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS

**Rationale:**

Week 2 delivered functional components with good test coverage on critical paths. While some gaps exist (missing tests for some components, incomplete data loading), these are **not blockers** for Week 3 work.

**Conditions for Proceeding:**

1. **Day 1 of Week 3 MUST address testing gaps** from Week 2
   - Add tests for modal, actionbar, layout, theme
   - Bring test coverage to 80% before proceeding with new features

2. **Data loading MUST be implemented** by end of Week 3 Day 2
   - LoadWorkspaces command
   - LoadTickets command
   - Error handling for data failures

3. **Document Week 2 architectural decisions** (ADRs)
   - Tree flattening approach
   - Modal system design
   - Component structure choices

**If Conditions Not Met:**
- Pause new feature work on Day 3
- Focus on closing gaps before proceeding
- Adjust Week 3 plan to prioritize stability over features

### Timeline Impact

**No impact to overall schedule.**

Week 2 completed on time (5 days). Week 3 plan is realistic given Week 2 learnings. Some features deferred from Week 2 (command palette, search, help) were intentionally moved to Week 3 to avoid scope creep.

**Revised Overall Timeline:**
- ✅ Week 1: Foundation (COMPLETE - 10/10)
- ✅ Week 2: Data & Components (COMPLETE - 7.5/10)
- 🔜 Week 3: Interactive Features (PLANNED - Target 8.5/10)
- Week 4-5: Tree Navigation & Bulk Operations
- Week 6-9: Sync Integration & Async Jobs
- Week 10-12: Polish & Effects
- Week 13-16: Testing & Hardening
- Week 17: Merge & Deploy

**Buffer:** 4 weeks built into original plan (Weeks 13-16). Can absorb minor delays.
