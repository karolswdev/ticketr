## Handover Notes

### For Steward Review
1. **Architecture compliance**: TUI follows hexagonal architecture (adapter → ports → core)
2. **Security posture**: No new security concerns introduced (uses existing BulkOperationService)
3. **Data safety**: All operations go through validated service layer
4. **Rollback mechanics**: Best-effort rollback documented with caveats
5. **User experience**: Comprehensive error handling and validation documented

### For Director
1. **Week 18 complete**: All 4 slices delivered and documented
2. **Commit ready**: Slice 4 ready for git commit
3. **No documentation debt**: All user-facing features documented
4. **No blockers**: Ready to proceed to Week 19 (Template system)

### Follow-Up Items
- None identified for Slice 4 documentation
- Future enhancement: Consider video walkthrough for TUI bulk operations (Week 20+)
