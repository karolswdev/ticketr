# User Acceptance Testing - v3.1.1 FAILED

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Tester:** Human (Project Owner)
**Build:** `./ticketr` binary in project directory
**Workspace:** `tbct` (EPM project)

## CRITICAL BLOCKER ISSUES

### ❌ BLOCKER #1: Async Pull Operation NOT WORKING - UI Completely Frozen

**Severity:** CRITICAL - RELEASE BLOCKER
**Feature:** Day 6-7 Async Job Queue Architecture
**Status:** FAILED

**Expected Behavior:**
- Pull operation runs asynchronously in background
- TUI remains responsive during pull
- User can navigate, switch panes, cancel operation
- Spinner animates to show progress
- This was THE ENTIRE POINT of Day 6-7 work

**Actual Behavior:**
1. Workspace `tbct` visible in left pane, but no tickets loaded
2. User switched to middle pane, pressed 'P' to pull
3. UI shows: `pull: ⠋ Querying project EPM...`
4. **Spinner is STATIC (not animating)**
5. **UI is COMPLETELY LOCKED UP**
   - Tab doesn't switch panes
   - No keyboard input accepted
   - UI frozen/hung
6. **Process appears to HANG indefinitely**

**Impact:**
- Async job queue is not functioning at all
- UI freezes just like pre-Phase 6 behavior
- User experience is WORSE than before (false promise of async)
- Progress indicators cannot be tested (blocked by this issue)
- Visual effects cannot be tested (blocked by this issue)
- Command palette cannot be tested (blocked by this issue)

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
- Pull operation not integrated with async job queue
- Still using synchronous blocking calls
- Async architecture implemented but NOT wired to pull command
- Integration failure between TUI and job queue

## Testing Status

### Tests Attempted

#### ✅ TEST 1: Launch TUI
**Result:** PASS
- TUI launches without errors
- Workspace visible in left pane

#### ❌ TEST 2: Pull Operation (Async)
**Result:** FAIL - CRITICAL BLOCKER
- See BLOCKER #1 above
- Cannot proceed with further testing

#### ❌ TEST 3: Workspace Pane - 'n' Key
**Result:** FAIL - BLOCKER
- Pressed 'n' in workspace pane
- **Expected:** Modal to create new workspace
- **Actual:** Nothing happens. No modal. No feedback. Dead key.

#### ❌ TEST 4: Help View - '?' Key
**Result:** FAIL - Documentation Mismatch
- Pressed '?' to view help
- Help view appears (GOOD)
- **BUT:** Keybindings list is outdated/incorrect:
  - Claims 'W' (Shift+w) opens credential management
  - **Actual:** 'W' does nothing or wrong action
  - Do we even HAVE credential management in TUI?
- **Severity:** HIGH - False documentation breaks user trust

#### ❌ TEST 5: Workspace Modal - 'w' Key
**Result:** FAIL - Terrible UX
- Pressed 'w' to open workspace modal
- Modal DOES appear (GOOD)
- **BUT:** Design is awful - "Are we back in the 80s?"
- No visual polish visible
- Looks like raw tview with no theming
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - Functional but embarrassing

#### ❌ TEST 6: Middle Pane - Ticket List Population
**Result:** FAIL - CRITICAL BLOCKER
- Workspace 'tbct' is valid and selected
- Middle pane (ticket list) is visible
- **Tickets NEVER populate**
- List remains empty despite valid workspace
- **Cannot test ticket-related features without this working**
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Core feature broken

#### ❌ TEST 7: Keybindings Section - Overflow
**Result:** FAIL - UX Issue
- When in middle pane, keybindings section updates (GOOD)
- **BUT:** List is too long for the space
- No scrolling, no marquee animation
- Text cuts off or overflows
- **Where are the smooth animations we built?**
- **Severity:** HIGH - Unusable help system

#### ❌ TEST 8: Visual Effects - MISSING
**Result:** FAIL - CRITICAL
- **NO animations visible anywhere**
- No spinners animating (static ⠋ character)
- No smooth transitions
- No visual polish from Day 12.5
- **Question:** Are visual effects even integrated?
- **Severity:** CRITICAL - Entire Day 12.5 work appears missing

#### ⏸️ REMAINING TESTS: BLOCKED
- Cannot test progress indicators (blocked by frozen UI and missing animations)
- Cannot test async cancellation (blocked by frozen UI)
- Cannot test command palette (blocked by missing features)
- Cannot test F-keys (many appear broken)
- Cannot test visual effects (NONE are visible)

## Tester Feedback (Verbatim)

> "I'm shocked. I'm appalled. This is so disappointing. What happened with the quality mark our orchestration system was known for?"

> "UI is totally locked up while the UI is stuck on pull: ⠋ Querying project EPM... tab doesn't jump to another pane, and so on, and so forth."

> "This is only the start. The process actually hang on it."

## Release Decision

**GO FOR RELEASE:** ❌ **ABSOLUTELY NO**

**Critical Blocker Count:** 4
1. UI freezes during pull operation (async not working)
2. Ticket list never populates (core feature broken)
3. 'n' key does nothing (workspace creation broken)
4. Visual effects completely missing (Day 12.5 not integrated)

**High Priority Issues:** 3
1. Outdated/incorrect help documentation
2. Keybindings overflow with no scrolling
3. Terrible modal UX ("back in the 80s")

**Total Issues Found:** 7 major failures in 15 minutes of testing

**Required Actions Before Release:**
1. Investigate why pull operation is NOT using async job queue
2. Fix pull integration with JobQueue
3. Verify UI remains responsive during pull
4. Re-test full UAT suite
5. Likely need new phase or hot-fix sprint

---

## Orchestration System Failure Analysis

**What Went Wrong:**

1. **Verification Gaps:**
   - Verifier tested unit tests (PASS)
   - Verifier tested race conditions (PASS)
   - Verifier did NOT test actual TUI pull operation end-to-end
   - Integration testing focused on test suite, not live TUI behavior

2. **Builder Integration Gaps:**
   - Async JobQueue implemented (Day 6-7)
   - Progress indicators implemented (Day 10-11)
   - Integration assumed but NOT verified in real TUI usage
   - Pull command may still call synchronous methods

3. **Steward Oversight:**
   - Approved release based on test results
   - Did not require live TUI validation
   - Trusted verification reports without manual testing

4. **Director Orchestration:**
   - Moved too quickly through phases
   - Did not require human-in-loop testing before Day 14
   - Should have mandated UAT before Steward approval

## Recommended Next Steps

### DIRECTOR ANALYSIS COMPLETE

After code inspection, the async job queue IS wired correctly in the code:
- `handlePull()` creates PullJob and submits to JobQueue ✓
- JobQueue workers are started ✓
- Progress monitoring is set up ✓

**However, the ROOT CAUSE is:**

The Jira adapter's `SearchTickets()` method is **completely synchronous** with:
- NO `context.Context` support
- NO cancellation capability
- NO progress reporting during HTTP calls
- Blocks for the entire duration of the Jira API call

Even though the job runs in a worker goroutine, the Jira HTTP call blocks that worker completely. The real question is: **why does this freeze the UI?**

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

**Path 1: Quick Investigation (15 minutes)**
1. User adds debug logging to confirm execution path
2. Check if older sync coordinator code path is being used instead
3. Verify binary is freshly built from current code

**Path 2: Emergency Fix (2-4 hours - Builder)**
1. Make Jira adapter context-aware
2. Add streaming progress to SearchTickets()
3. Implement HTTP timeout and cancellation
4. Re-test with user

**Path 3: Hotfix Workaround (30 minutes - Builder)**
1. Add "Searching..." progress events during Jira call
2. Make HTTP client timeout shorter (e.g., 30s)
3. Won't fix freezing, but will improve UX

---

### PROCESS FAILURES IDENTIFIED

1. **No Manual UAT Before Steward** - Fatal oversight
2. **Verifier only tested unit tests** - Not end-to-end behavior
3. **Integration testing used mocks** - Not real Jira
4. **Builder never tested against live Jira** - Critical gap
5. **Director rushed through phases** - Should have mandated UAT earlier

---

## Status: RELEASE ABSOLUTELY BLOCKED

**This is a PHASE 6.5 or Phase 7 situation - we need a fix sprint.**

**Cannot proceed to v3.1.1 release until:**
1. Root cause fully diagnosed (is it Jira adapter or something else?)
2. Fix implemented and tested
3. Human UAT passes

---

## Next Phase Recommendation

**Phase 6.5: Emergency Fix Sprint**
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Fix async pull operation freezing
- **Agents**: Builder (investigate + fix), Verifier (test with real Jira), Human (UAT)
- **Acceptance**: User can pull tickets without UI freeze

**DO NOT PROCEED TO DAY 15 RELEASE WITHOUT FIXING THIS.**
