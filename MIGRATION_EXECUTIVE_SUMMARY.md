# Bubbletea Migration - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-22
**Decision:** APPROVED FOR FULL MIGRATION
**Timeline:** 16-18 weeks
**Risk Level:** Medium-High (justified)

---

## The Decision

After comprehensive analysis of:
- Current Tview architecture (46 Go files, complex state management)
- Bubbletea patterns and ecosystem maturity
- Extensible action system requirements
- UI wireframes and visual design goals

**VERDICT: Full migration to Bubbletea is APPROVED.**

---

## Why Migrate?

### Current Pain Points (Tview)
1. **Race conditions everywhere** - serviceMutex, multiple RWMutex, manual synchronization
2. **Callback hell** - event handlers scattered across files, hard to trace
3. **Manual focus management** - complex state tracking with `currentFocus` strings
4. **No extensibility** - adding actions requires modifying core code
5. **Testing difficulty** - callbacks are hard to test, state is implicit

### Bubbletea Benefits
1. **Eliminates race conditions** - single-threaded message loop, no mutexes needed
2. **Declarative state** - single source of truth in Model struct
3. **Pure functions** - Update() is testable, View() has no side effects
4. **Extensible architecture** - plugin-ready action system from day one
5. **Modern ecosystem** - active development, production-proven, better docs

## What We're Building

### Vision
Midnight Commander-inspired dual-panel TUI with:
- High FPS (60 target), no rendering artifacts
- Extensible action system (future Lua plugin support)
- Visual effects (animations, shimmer, gradients)
- Context-aware keybindings
- Vim-style navigation

### Core Features
✅ Workspace management with sync indicators
✅ Hierarchical ticket tree with multi-selection
✅ Dual-panel layout (tree | detail)
✅ Fuzzy search with advanced filters
✅ Command palette (all actions discoverable)
✅ Bulk operations with progress tracking
✅ Real-time sync with Jira
✅ Multiple themes (Default, Dark, Arctic)

### Deferred (Stretch Goals)
⚠️ Background particle effects (cosmic/hyperspace) - Phase 6.5
⚠️ Lua plugin system - Post v3.2.0
⚠️ Advanced features (tri-panel, PiP, etc.) - Future versions

---

## Timeline

### Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Setup project structure
- Build action system
- Prove out patterns with simple view (Help)

### Phase 1: Core Views (Weeks 3-6) ⚠️ CRITICAL PATH
- Workspace list (Week 3)
- **Ticket tree** (Weeks 4-5) - HIGHEST COMPLEXITY
- Ticket detail (Week 6)

### Phase 2: Modals & Widgets (Weeks 7-9)
- Search modal
- Command palette
- Action bar, status bar, progress widgets

### Phase 3: Async & Sync (Weeks 10-11)
- Job queue integration
- Sync operations (pull, push, full)
- Bulk operations modal

### Phase 4: Visual Polish (Weeks 12-14)
- Animation system
- Marquee widget
- Multiple themes
- Effects (shimmer, transitions)

### Phase 5: Testing & Docs (Weeks 15-16)
- Comprehensive test suite (>80% coverage)
- Architecture documentation
- Migration guide
- User documentation

### Phase 6: Rollout (Weeks 17-18)
- Beta release (v3.2.0-beta)
- Bug fixes and performance tuning
- Stable release (v3.2.0)
- Bubbletea becomes default

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Elm Architecture (Model-View-Update)
```
State Changes: Message → Update(Model) → New Model → View()
```
- Single source of truth
- Pure functions
- Predictable state transitions

### 2. Custom Tree Component
**Decision:** Build our own (no suitable library exists)
- Full control over rendering
- Multi-selection support
- Vim keybindings
- Performance optimized for 1000+ tickets

**Fallback:** bubbles/list with indentation if tree proves too complex

### 3. Action System Architecture
```
User Input → Keybinding → Action (with predicate) → Execute → Message → Update
```
- Declarative action definitions
- Context-aware visibility
- Plugin-ready from day one
- Future Lua integration planned

### 4. Component Strategy

| Need | Solution | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| List | bubbles/list | Production-ready |
| Forms | huh/v2 | Best-in-class |
| Tree | Custom | No alternative |
| Layout | Lipgloss | Simple, native |
| Modals | Custom + Lipgloss | Full control |

### 5. Parallel Development
- Keep Tview working during migration
- Build Bubbletea in parallel (`internal/adapters/bubbletea/`)
- Feature flag: `TICKETR_USE_BUBBLETEA=true`
- Gradual cutover minimizes risk

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Risk: Tree Component Complexity
**Threat:** No built-in tree, complex state management, performance concerns
**Mitigation:**
- Allocate 2 weeks (Weeks 4-5)
- Early prototype in Phase 0
- Performance benchmarks mandatory
- Fallback: bubbles/list with indentation

### Medium Risk: Background Particles
**Threat:** ANSI compositing is complex, performance impact
**Mitigation:**
- **DEFER to Phase 6.5** (not required for MVP)
- Ship without particles initially
- Revisit after v3.2.0 stable

### Medium Risk: Team Learning Curve
**Threat:** Elm Architecture is new paradigm
**Mitigation:**
- Documentation-first approach
- Pair programming encouraged
- Code examples in every component
- Weekly architecture syncs

---

## Quality Gates

### Performance Targets
- **Frame rate:** 60 FPS (all views)
- **Render time:** <16ms (tree, detail)
- **Search response:** <100ms
- **Key press latency:** <50ms
- **Startup time:** <500ms

### Code Quality Targets
- **Test coverage:** >80% overall
- **Action system:** 100% coverage
- **Cyclomatic complexity:** <15 per function
- **No TODOs** before release

### Visual Quality
- No flicker or tearing
- Responsive resize (<100ms)
- All components themed
- High contrast mode readable

## Rollout Strategy

### Beta Period (Week 17)
```bash
# Tview still default
./ticketr                           # Uses Tview
TICKETR_USE_BUBBLETEA=true ./ticketr  # Uses Bubbletea (beta)
```

### Stable Release (Week 18)
```bash
# Bubbletea becomes default
./ticketr                           # Uses Bubbletea ✅
TICKETR_USE_TVIEW=true ./ticketr     # Fallback to Tview
```

### Future Deprecation
- **v3.3.0** (+6 months): Tview deprecated, warning on use
- **v4.0.0** (+12 months): Tview removed entirely

---

## Success Criteria

### Migration Complete When:
- [x] All Tview features ported
- [x] Test coverage >80%
- [x] Performance targets met
- [x] No critical bugs
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] Beta testing successful
- [x] v3.2.0 released with Bubbletea as default

### Long-Term Success:
- After 3 months: <5 minor bugs, no revert requests
- After 6 months: Bubbletea adoption >90%
- After 12 months: Plugin ecosystem thriving, Tview removed

---

## Investment vs. Return

### Investment
- **Time:** 16-18 weeks (4-4.5 months)
- **Team effort:** 1-2 developers full-time
- **Risk:** Medium-High (mitigated with parallel development)

### Return
1. **Eliminate race conditions** - No more mutex hell, fewer bugs
2. **Easier testing** - Pure functions, predictable state
3. **Better maintainability** - Declarative, composable architecture
4. **Future-proof** - Plugin system, community extensions
5. **Modern stack** - Active ecosystem, better docs, community support

### ROI: Justified
- One-time migration cost
- Long-term maintainability gains
- Enables features not possible with Tview (plugins!)
- Team velocity increases after learning curve

## Next Steps

1. **Present plan** to team for review
2. **Create GitHub Project** with all tasks
3. **Assign Phase 0** to Builder agent
4. **Week 1 kickoff** - Directory structure, action system
5. **Weekly check-ins** every Friday
6. **Adjust as needed** based on learnings
