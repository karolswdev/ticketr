# Jira Story Creator - Software Requirements Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Baseline

## Introduction

This document outlines the software requirements for the **Jira Story Creator**. It serves as the single source of truth for what the system must do, the constraints under which it must operate, and the rules governing its development and deployment.

Each requirement has a **unique, stable ID** (e.g., `PROD-001`). These IDs **MUST** be used to link implementation stories and test cases back to these foundational requirements, ensuring complete traceability.

The requirement keywords (`MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`, `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`) are used as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## 1. Product & Functional Requirements

*Defines what the system does; its core features and capabilities.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="PROD-001"></a>**PROD-001** | **Core:** File-Based State | The system **MUST** operate on an input Markdown file and produce a new Markdown file as its primary output. This output file **MUST** be a valid input file for subsequent runs, with Jira Issue Keys injected for all successfully processed items. | This creates a self-contained, idempotent workflow that supports easy recovery from failures and iterative updates. The file itself becomes the record of the system's state. |
| <a name="PROD-002"></a>**PROD-002** | Hierarchical Validation | The system **MUST** validate input hierarchically. If a story's definition is malformed, the story and all its child tasks **MUST** be rejected as a single unit. | To prevent the creation of orphaned tasks or incomplete stories in Jira, ensuring data integrity. |
| <a name="PROD-003"></a>**PROD-003** | Rich Create & Update Logic | The system **MUST** support both "create" and "update" operations for stories and tasks, triggered by the presence of a Jira Issue Key (e.g., `[PROJ-456]`). When updating a story, the system **MUST** update its fields in Jira and **MUST** also process its child tasks (creating or updating them as required). | To provide a comprehensive, "single source of truth" workflow where the Markdown file's state can be fully synchronized with Jira. |
| <a name="PROD-004"></a>**PROD-004** | Human-Readable Logging | The system **MUST** write a summary of its execution to a local, human-readable flat text log file, in addition to the console. | To provide a persistent and easily reviewable record of the application's execution for auditing and debugging purposes. |
| <a name="PROD-005"></a>**PROD-005** | Rich Task Definitions | The system **MUST** be able to parse and sync a `Description` and `Acceptance Criteria` for individual tasks, in addition to their titles. | To allow for the creation of detailed, well-defined tasks that do not require immediate follow-up in the Jira UI. |

## 2. User Interaction Requirements

*Defines how a user interacts with the system. Focuses on usability and user-facing workflows.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="USER-001"></a>**USER-001** | Non-Interactive Error Handling | By default, if a story contains any malformed tasks, the entire story **MUST** be skipped. The system **SHOULD** provide a command-line flag (e.g., `--force-partial-upload`) to override this and upload valid tasks from a partially invalid story. | To ensure predictable, script-friendly behavior by default, while providing an override for users who need to perform partial uploads. |
| <a name="USER-002"></a>**USER-002** | Detailed Execution Report | The final summary report **MUST** include: 1. A list of all successfully created/updated items with direct links to them in the Jira UI. 2. A list of all failed items with a clear reason for failure and their source line number. | To provide a clear, actionable summary of the outcome, enabling users to verify results and debug failures efficiently. |
| <a name="USER-003"></a>**USER-003** | Verbose Output Mode | The system **SHOULD** provide a command-line flag (e.g., `--verbose`) that prints a detailed, real-time log of all operations to the console. | To allow users to monitor the application's progress in detail during execution for debugging or observation. |

## 3. Architectural Requirements

*Defines high-level, non-negotiable design principles and structural constraints.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="ARCH-001"></a>**ARCH-001** | Ports & Adapters | The system architecture **MUST** adhere to the Ports and Adapters (Hexagonal) pattern for its core components. | To decouple the core application logic from external concerns (like the Jira API or the command-line interface), improving testability, maintainability, and flexibility. |

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

*Defines the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the system. The "-ilities".*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="NFR-001"></a>**NFR-001** | **Security:** MVP Credentials | For the MVP, the system **MUST** consume Jira credentials from environment variables. | To provide a simple and widely supported method for secret management in containerized environments for the initial version. |
| <a name="NFR-002"></a>**NFR-002** | **Reliability:** Graceful API Error Handling | The system **MUST** gracefully handle and report API errors from Jira related to user permissions and project-specific validation rules. | To provide clear, actionable feedback to the user when an API call fails, enabling them to diagnose and resolve the underlying issue in Jira. |

---

## 5. Technology & Platform Requirements

*Defines the specific technologies, frameworks, and platforms that are mandated for use.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="TECH-P-001"></a>**TECH-P-001** | **Primary Language:** Go | The application's backend **MUST** be implemented using Go. | To build a performant, single-binary executable that is well-suited for containerized, command-line applications. |

---

## 6. Operational & DevOps Requirements

*Defines the rules and constraints governing the development workflow, build process, and execution environment.*

| ID | Title | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <a name="DEV-001"></a>**DEV-001** | **Containerized Execution** | The application **MUST** be distributed and executed as a Docker container. | To ensure a consistent, portable, and isolated execution environment, abstracting away the host machine's configuration. |
