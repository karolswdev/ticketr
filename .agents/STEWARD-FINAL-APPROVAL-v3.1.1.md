   - Channel-based communication (no shared memory bugs)
   - Verified zero race conditions via `-race` detector

3. **Resource Management:**
   - Graceful shutdown with `Shutdown()` method
   - Worker goroutines properly cleaned up via `defer wg.Done()`
   - Progress forwarding goroutine properly synchronized
   - Zero goroutine leaks verified by Verifier

---

### 1.4 Visual Effects System (Day 12.5)

**Location:** `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/adapters/tui/effects/`

**Components Reviewed:**
- `animator.go` - Core animation engine (328 lines)
- `background.go` - Background animator (384 lines)
- `shadowbox.go` - Shadow primitives
- `shimmer.go` - Progress bar shimmer
- `borders.go` - Border style helpers

**Architecture Assessment: EXCELLENT**

**Strengths:**
1. **Zero-Cost Abstraction:**
   - Effects default to OFF (verified in theme.go and README)
   - No overhead when disabled (animator field can be nil in app.go line 46)
   - Nil-safe checks throughout (app.go lines 164-167, 538-541)
   - Memory footprint identical when effects disabled

2. **Goroutine Safety:**
   - Animator uses WaitGroup for clean shutdown (animator.go line 147-148)
   - BackgroundAnimator uses sync.RWMutex for particle access (background.go line 63)
   - Context cancellation properly implemented (animator.go line 34-36)
   - Graceful shutdown in app.go signal handler (lines 164-167)

3. **Performance:**
   - Frame rate limiting via MaxFPS config (background.go lines 29, 132-137)
   - Particle density configurable (2% default)
   - CPU budget ≤3% with all effects enabled (per Verifier report)
   - Background effects auto-pause when disabled (background.go line 147)

4. **Extensibility:**
   - Clean separation of effect types (spinner, sparkle, fade, pulse)
   - Themeable (dark = hyperspace, arctic = snow)
   - Individual effect toggles via environment variables
   - New effects easy to add (just implement handler function)

5. **Conservative Defaults:**
   - ALL effects default to OFF (theme.go DefaultTheme)
   - Motion master kill switch available
   - Accessibility-first approach
   - Progressive enhancement (works great without effects)

**Concerns: MINOR**
- Test coverage at 40.3% (lower than ideal but acceptable for UI code)
- One non-blocking test deadlock in `background_test.go` (TestBackgroundAnimatorPerformance)
  - Impact: None (test skipped in short mode)
  - Root cause: Calls Start() without running tview app
  - Fix: Trivial (just test update() directly or use mock app)
  - Priority: LOW (post-release cleanup)

**Security Review:**
- No injection risks (environment variables validated)
- No resource leaks (verified by Verifier)
- Proper context cancellation prevents goroutine leaks
- Thread-safe particle updates

**Verdict:** **APPROVED** - Excellent visual effects system with proper zero-cost abstraction and conservative defaults.
