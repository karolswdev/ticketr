## Documentation Philosophy Applied

### 1. User-Focused Language

**Avoided**:
- Technical jargon ("goroutine workers", "frame rate coalescing")
- Implementation details ("tview primitives", "context cancellation")
- Developer-centric terms ("CPU profiling", "race detector")

**Used**:
- Benefit-oriented language ("transforms interface", "creates depth")
- Concrete examples (copy-paste commands)
- Visual descriptions ("stars streaming", "gentle snowfall")

### 2. Accessibility First

**Emphasized Throughout**:
- Default OFF for all enhancement effects
- Opt-in philosophy clearly stated
- Performance impact transparently documented
- Global kill switch prominently featured
- Graceful degradation on limited terminals
- Never impairs legibility or core functionality

**Accessibility Notes**:
- Added to TUI-GUIDE.md Accessibility section (line 755)
- Dedicated section in VISUAL_EFFECTS_CONFIG.md
- Mentioned in every configuration example

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

**Documentation Hierarchy**:
1. **README.md**: High-level philosophy and quick examples (marketing tone)
2. **TUI-GUIDE.md**: User guide with configuration and troubleshooting (instructional tone)
3. **VISUAL_EFFECTS_CONFIG.md**: Quick reference with presets (copy-paste focus)
4. **TUI_VISUAL_EFFECTS.md**: Technical documentation (existing, for developers)
5. **VISUAL_EFFECTS_QUICK_START.md**: Integration guide (existing, for contributors)

Users start simple (README) and drill down as needed. No need to read technical docs to use visual effects.

### 4. Examples Over Explanation

**Every configuration includes**:
- Copy-paste bash commands
- Expected results description
- When to use (use cases)
- Performance implications

Users can try immediately without reading entire document.

## Functionality Gaps Discovered

### No Critical Gaps

Documentation accurately reflects implementation as described in:
- `TUI_VISUAL_EFFECTS.md` (technical docs from TUIUX)
- `VISUAL_EFFECTS_QUICK_START.md` (integration guide from TUIUX)
- Environment variable configuration (from Builder integration)

### Assumptions Made

1. **Environment Variables**: Documentation assumes Builder implemented environment variable reading as specified:
   - `TICKETR_THEME`
   - `TICKETR_EFFECTS_MOTION`
   - `TICKETR_EFFECTS_SHADOWS`
   - `TICKETR_EFFECTS_SHIMMER`
   - `TICKETR_EFFECTS_AMBIENT`

2. **Themes Available**: Assumed three themes (default, dark, arctic) per technical specification

3. **Default Values**: Assumed effects default to OFF (except spinners) as specified

**Recommendation**: Verifier should confirm environment variables are read correctly and defaults match documentation.

## Downstream Updates Needed

### Release Notes

**Action Required**: Add visual effects feature to v3.1.1 release notes

**Suggested Content**:
```markdown
### Visual Effects System

Ticketr v3.1.1 introduces optional visual enhancements for the TUI:

- **The Four Principles**: Subtle motion, light & shadow, atmospheric effects, quality details
- **Themeable**: Choose from default, dark (hyperspace), or arctic (snow) themes
- **Optional**: All effects disabled by default for accessibility
- **Performance-Efficient**: Less than 5% CPU with all effects enabled
- **Configurable**: Environment variables control each effect category

See [TUI-GUIDE.md](docs/TUI-GUIDE.md#visual-effects) and
[VISUAL_EFFECTS_CONFIG.md](docs/VISUAL_EFFECTS_CONFIG.md) for details.
```

### CHANGELOG.md

**Action Required**: Add to v3.1.1 CHANGELOG

**Suggested Entry**:
```markdown
### Added
- Visual effects system for TUI with four design principles
- Three themes: default (minimal), dark (hyperspace), arctic (snow)
- Optional animations, shadows, shimmer, and ambient backgrounds
- Environment variable configuration (TICKETR_THEME, TICKETR_EFFECTS_*)
- Comprehensive visual effects documentation
```

### ROADMAP.md

## Recommendations for Verifier

### Documentation Verification

**Verify**:
1. All environment variables in docs match implementation
2. Default values (effects OFF) match code behavior
3. Theme names (default, dark, arctic) match implementation
4. Performance claims (CPU percentages) are accurate
5. Example commands work as documented
6. Troubleshooting advice is correct

### Functional Testing

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Launch with no environment variables → effects should be OFF
2. Set `TICKETR_THEME=dark` → verify dark theme loads
3. Set `TICKETR_EFFECTS_AMBIENT=true` with dark theme → verify hyperspace stars
4. Set `TICKETR_EFFECTS_MOTION=false` → verify no spinners/animations
5. Try each preset from VISUAL_EFFECTS_CONFIG.md → verify matches description

### Link Validation

**Check**:
- [ ] All internal links in README.md work
- [ ] All internal links in TUI-GUIDE.md work
- [ ] All internal links in VISUAL_EFFECTS_CONFIG.md work
- [ ] All internal links in MARKETING_GIF_SPECIFICATION.md work
- [ ] Cross-references between docs are accurate

## Recommendations for Builder

### Missing Documentation Noticed

**None** - All Builder-implemented features appear to be covered by TUIUX technical documentation.

### Integration Points

**Verify** these integration points match documentation:
1. Environment variable reading (`os.Getenv()` for `TICKETR_*` variables)
2. Theme loading based on `TICKETR_THEME` value
3. Effect toggles based on `TICKETR_EFFECTS_*` boolean parsing
4. Default values when environment variables not set

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Clear Specifications**: TUIUX technical documentation provided solid foundation
2. **User Focus**: Prioritizing user-facing language over technical accuracy improved accessibility
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Layered documentation (README → TUI-GUIDE → Config → Technical) serves all audiences
4. **Flexibility**: GIF specification allows future recording without blocking release

### Challenges

1. **Balancing Technical Accuracy with Marketing**: Had to maintain enthusiasm while staying truthful about capabilities
2. **Environment Variables**: Documented based on specification; verification needed to confirm implementation matches
3. **Performance Claims**: Used estimates from technical docs; real-world testing will refine numbers

### Process Improvements

1. **Earlier Scribe Involvement**: Scribe could draft user docs while TUIUX builds, allowing parallel work
2. **Marketing Earlier**: GIF specification should be created during design phase, not post-implementation
3. **Example Testing**: Ideally, Scribe would test all example commands before documenting (deferred to Verifier)
