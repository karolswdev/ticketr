# Agent Archive

This directory contains historical agent handover documents and verification reports from Phase 6 development.

## Purpose

These documents served as day-to-day coordination artifacts during active development but are no longer needed for operational context. They are archived here for:

- Historical reference
- Development process transparency
- Lessons learned analysis
- Audit trail preservation

## Contents

### Phase 6 Day 8-9 (TUI Menu Structure)
- `handover-day8-9-builder.md` - Builder's implementation handover

### Phase 6 Day 12 (Integration Testing)
- `verification-report-phase6-day12.md` - Complete integration testing results

### Phase 6 Day 12.5 (Visual Effects)
- `handover-day12.5-scribe.md` - Scribe's documentation handover
- `handover-day12.5-tuiux.md` - TUIUX's implementation handover
- `verifier-handoff-visual-effects.md` - Verifier test plan
- `verifier-report-visual-effects.md` - Verifier final report
- `visual-effects-integration-summary.md` - Integration summary

### Historical Orchestration
- `handover-milestone-12.md` - Milestone 12 handover
- `milestone-orchestrator-prompt.md` - Orchestrator prompt template

## Current Agent Definitions

Active agent definitions remain in the parent directory:

- `.agents/builder.agent.md`
- `.agents/verifier.agent.md`
- `.agents/scribe.agent.md`
- `.agents/steward.agent.md`
- `.agents/director.agent.md`
- `.agents/tuiux.agent.md`

## Cleanup Rationale

**Archived on**: 2025-10-20 (Phase 6 Day 13 - Documentation Finalization)

**Reason**: Week 2 TUI UX improvements complete and verified. Transitive handover documents served their purpose during development but add clutter for ongoing maintenance. Agent definitions and final verification reports provide sufficient context for future work.

**Status**: All archived work successfully integrated into main codebase. No action items remain from these documents.
