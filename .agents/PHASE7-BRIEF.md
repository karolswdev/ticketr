# Phase 7 Agent Briefing - Jira Domain Architecture Review

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Phase:** 7 - Jira Domain Architecture Review
**Status:** READY TO INITIATE
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Foundation for all future work
**Branch:** feature/jira-domain-redesign

---

## To All Agents: Read This First

This is the most important phase in the project's lifecycle. Phase 6.5 revealed that our Jira integration architecture is fundamentally flawed. The human has lost confidence and demanded a comprehensive review.

**What makes this different:**
- This is NOT about implementation. This is about DESIGN.
- This is NOT about speed. This is about RIGOR.
- This is NOT about patches. This is about PRINCIPLES.
- Human approval is REQUIRED before any implementation begins.

**Your role:**
- Question everything. Don't accept current design as given.
- Research deeply. Learn from industry leaders.
- Document thoroughly. Every decision needs rationale.
- Work together. This requires all agents collaborating.

**Bottom line:**
The human said: "THE DOMAIN MUST BE SOLID."

We will make it solid.

  - Type safety through code generation
- **Deliverable:** 6-10 pages documenting these two patterns

### Day 2 Tasks (12 hours)

**Morning (4 hours):**
- Research Atlassian Connect framework: https://developer.atlassian.com/
  - How does Atlassian design for extensibility?
  - Field discovery and metadata patterns
  - Best practices from their own SDK
- Research DDD Literature:
  - Eric Evans: "Domain-Driven Design" patterns
  - Vaughn Vernon: "Implementing DDD"
  - Martin Fowler: "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture"
  - Focus on: Aggregates, value objects, repositories
- **Deliverable:** 6-10 pages documenting these sources

**Afternoon (4 hours):**

  - ADR-007: Conflict Resolution Strategy
- Review with Director for alignment
- **Deliverable:** 7 ADRs in draft form (2-3 pages each)

### How to Succeed

**Research Deeply:**
- Don't just read docs. Look at actual code.
- Find design decisions in commit history and issues.
- Understand WHY they chose certain patterns.

**Document Thoroughly:**
- Every pattern gets: Overview, Strengths, Weaknesses, Applicability, Recommendation
- Code examples are required, not optional.
- Show trade-offs, not just benefits.

**Think Critically:**
- Just because GitHub does it doesn't mean it's right for us.
- Document when patterns DON'T apply and why.
- Alternative approaches should be mentioned.

**Communicate Clearly:**
- Write for the human to understand.
- Use diagrams where helpful.
- Concrete examples > abstract descriptions.

### Pitfalls to Avoid

**Analysis Paralysis:**
- Research has time limits. Good enough is better than perfect.
- Day 1-2 ONLY for research. Don't extend without approval.

**Superficial Analysis:**
- "GitHub SDK looks good" is not enough.
- Need 3-5 pages per source minimum with code examples.

**Copying Without Understanding:**
- Don't just copy patterns because they're popular.
- Understand context and applicability.

### Day 3 Tasks (12 hours)

**Morning (4 hours):**
- Review Steward's External Validation Report thoroughly
- Review all 7 ADRs
- Design new domain model:

  - `/prototypes/ports/issue_tracker.go`
  - `/prototypes/ports/errors.go`
- Steward reviews prototypes and provides feedback
- Iterate on design based on feedback
- **Deliverable:** Prototype code (throwaway, for validation only)

### Day 4 Tasks (12 hours)

**Morning (4 hours):**
- Design Jira adapter component decomposition:
  - JiraTransport (HTTP, auth, retries)
  - JiraSerializer (JSON ↔ Domain)
  - JiraFieldMapper (field name ↔ ID)
  - JiraMetadataCache (cached metadata)
- Design field mapping architecture (strongly-typed)
- Design metadata caching strategy (TTL, invalidation)
- **Deliverable:** Adapter Architecture Specification (draft)

**Afternoon (4 hours):**
- Design service layer:
  - Push use case
  - Pull use case
  - Sync use case
  - Batch operations use case
- Document transaction boundaries
- Design conflict resolution strategy (extending current)
- Design repository consolidation (single source of truth)
- **Deliverable:** Service Layer Specification (8-10 pages)

**Evening (4 hours - with Steward):**
- Create adapter prototype code
  - `/prototypes/adapters/jira_transport.go`
  - `/prototypes/adapters/jira_serializer.go`
  - `/prototypes/adapters/jira_adapter.go`
- Create service prototype code
  - `/prototypes/services/push_service.go`
  - `/prototypes/services/pull_service.go`
- Create test strategy document (5-7 pages)
- Steward performs final design review
- **Deliverable:** All prototypes, test strategy, Steward approval

### How to Succeed

**Design for System-Agnostic:**
- Nothing in domain should mention "Jira"
- Ports should work for GitHub, Linear, etc.
- Test by imagining GitHub adapter implementation

**Strong Typing Over Strings:**
- `Priority.High` not `"High"`
- `StoryPointsField{5}` not `map["Story Points"]="5"`
- Compile-time safety wherever possible

**Think in Use Cases:**
- Services are use case driven, not CRUD
- "Push issues to remote tracker" not "Update ticket"
- Transaction boundaries follow use cases

**Prototype Don't Implement:**
- Prototypes are throwaway exploration
- Don't write production-quality code yet
- Goal is to validate design feasibility

### Pitfalls to Avoid

**Over-Engineering:**
- Simple is better than clever
- Don't add abstractions not needed yet
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

**Under-Specifying:**
- Specs must be detailed enough to implement
- Vague descriptions won't work
- Code examples required

**Ignoring Steward Feedback:**
- Steward reviews are not optional
- Incorporate feedback immediately
- Iterate until approval

## For Verifier: Your Support Role

**You are on standby for Phase 7, active in implementation phases.**

### Phase 7 (Days 1-5)

**Limited Role:**
- Review prototype code for basic correctness (compiles, runs)
- Provide feedback on test strategy (Day 4)
- No extensive testing during design phase

**Why Limited:**
- Phase 7 is design, not implementation
- Prototypes are throwaway, not production
- Main verification happens in Phase 7.1-7.6

### Post-Approval (Weeks 1-4)

**Critical Role:**
- Phase 7.1: Verify domain model tests (100% coverage)
- Phase 7.2: Create contract tests for ports
- Phase 7.3: Integration tests for Jira adapter
- Phase 7.4: Service integration tests, regression suite
- Phase 7.6: Performance validation and benchmarks

**Preparation During Phase 7:**
- Read all specifications thoroughly
- Understand test strategy
- Plan contract test approach
- Identify integration test scenarios

---

## For Scribe: Your Documentation Role

**You are on standby for Phase 7, active in implementation phases.**

### Phase 7 (Days 1-5)

**Limited Role:**
- Review documentation for clarity and consistency
- Provide feedback on spec readability
- No major documentation updates during design

**Why Limited:**
- Phase 7 focuses on architecture, not user docs
- Main documentation work happens after implementation

### Post-Approval (Weeks 1-4)

**Critical Role:**
- Phase 7.1: Document new domain concepts for developers
- Phase 7.2: Document port interfaces for adapter implementers
- Phase 7.3: Update Jira adapter documentation
- Phase 7.4: Update service layer documentation
- Phase 7.5: Update all user-facing docs to reflect changes

**Preparation During Phase 7:**
- Read all specifications thoroughly
- Identify documentation gaps
- Plan documentation structure
- Understand ubiquitous language

---

## For TUIUX: Your Observational Role

**You are on standby for Phase 7 and implementation phases.**

### Phase 7 (Days 1-5)

**No Active Role:**
- Phase 7 does not touch TUI
- Backend architecture only

**Why No Role:**
- TUI depends on services, not domain/adapter directly
- Service interfaces remain stable
- TUI changes (if any) happen after implementation

### Post-Implementation (Weeks 4+)

**Potential Role:**
- If service interfaces change: Update TUI integration
- If progress reporting changes: Update TUI indicators
- Visual effects work continues independently

**Preparation During Phase 7:**
- Understand service layer changes
- Identify potential TUI impacts
- Plan integration updates if needed

---

## Critical Success Factors for All Agents

### 1. Collaborate Actively

**This is a TEAM effort:**
- Steward researches, Builder designs, Director synthesizes
- Daily communication (async standups)
- Quick feedback loops
- Help each other succeed

**Communication Channels:**
- Commit messages: Clear, detailed
- Handoff notes: Explicit, actionable
- Questions: Ask early, don't guess

### 2. Question Everything

**Don't accept current design as gospel:**
- "Why is it this way?" is a good question
- "Could we do it differently?" is a good question
- "What are the trade-offs?" is a good question

**Challenge Assumptions:**
- Jira-centricity: Why assume only Jira forever?
- String maps: Why not strong types?
- Single repository: Why three repositories?

### 3. Document Rigorously

**Every decision needs rationale:**
- WHY did we choose this approach?
- WHAT alternatives did we consider?
- WHAT are the trade-offs?
- HOW will we implement it?

**Quality Bar:**
- Clear writing (human will read this)
- Code examples (show, don't just tell)
- Diagrams (complex concepts need visuals)
- Trade-offs (honest assessment)

### 4. Validate Externally

**Learn from industry leaders:**
- GitHub Octokit: Resource-based API design
- Stripe SDK: Error handling taxonomy
- AWS SDK: Modular architecture
- Linear API: Type-safe GraphQL
- Atlassian: Extensibility patterns
- DDD Literature: Domain modeling principles

**Don't Reinvent:**
- If pattern is proven, adopt it
- If pattern doesn't fit, document why
- Learn from others' mistakes

### 5. Focus on Principles

**SOLID:**
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

**DDD:**
- Ubiquitous Language
- Bounded Contexts
- Aggregates
- Value Objects
- Repositories

**Hexagonal:**
- Domain independence
- Ports defined by domain
- Adapters depend on ports
- Clear inside/outside

**These are not optional. These are the foundation.**

### 6. Get Human Approval

**Nothing happens without human approval:**
- Human reviews Architecture Review Package
- Human approves or requests changes
- Human explicitly says "proceed to implementation"
- NO CODE written until approval

**Why This Matters:**
- Human has lost confidence (Phase 6.5 failures)
- Human must regain confidence through rigor
- Human's mandate: "THE DOMAIN MUST BE SOLID"
- This approval is the most important milestone

---

## What Makes This Phase Different

### Past Phases

**Phase 6 approach:**
- Implement features quickly
- Test after implementation
- Fix bugs as they arise
- Ship when tests pass

**Phase 6.5 approach:**
- Emergency fixes
- Band-aid patches
- Multiple attempts
- 75% failure rate

**Why this didn't work:**
- Foundation was broken
- Tactical fixes on strategic problems
- No time for proper design
- Human lost confidence

### Phase 7 Approach

**Design first, implement later:**
- 5 days for analysis and design
- External validation required
- Human approval mandatory
- Only then: 4 weeks implementation

**Why this will work:**
- Fix foundation first
- Strategic approach to strategic problems
- Time for proper principles
- Human confidence restored through rigor

**The Difference:**
```
Phase 6: Code → Test → Fix → Ship
Phase 7: Research → Design → Approve → Implement → Test → Ship

Phase 6: Speed first
Phase 7: Solid first

Phase 6: "Ship it!"
Phase 7: "Is it right?"
```

## Human's Expectations

### What the Human Said

> "I DEMAND A THOROUGH REVIEW PHASE OF THE CURRENT JIRA SERVICE, JIRA ADAPTER. I WANT YOU TO QUESTION EVERYTHING IN THAT PHASE, THE DESIGN, ARE WE ROBUST ENOUGH? ARE WE PROVIDING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION AND DESIGN FOR FLEXIBILITY?"

> "ARE WE CHECKING THIS WITH HEADLESS VERSIONS OF GEMINI-CLI AND CODEX TO FIND OUT OTHER VIEWPOINTS ON THIS? THE DOMAIN MUST BE SOLID."

### What the Human Means

**Demand:** Not a request. This is mandatory.

**Thorough:** Not superficial. Deep analysis required.

**Question Everything:** Don't assume anything is correct.

**Robust:** Can it handle production? Edge cases? Failures?

**Flexibility:** Can we add GitHub/Linear without rewriting?

**External Validation:** Don't just trust ourselves. Learn from others.

**THE DOMAIN MUST BE SOLID:** This is the non-negotiable requirement.

### How to Meet These Expectations

**Thorough:**
- 20+ pages of external validation
- 7 detailed ADRs
- Complete specifications
- Prototype code validation

**Questioning:**
- Every design choice documented with rationale
- Alternatives considered
- Trade-offs explicit

**Robust:**
- Error taxonomy covers all failure modes
- Retry semantics clear
- Batch operations for performance
- Transaction boundaries defined

**Flexible:**
- System-agnostic abstractions
- GitHub adapter implementable without domain changes
- Field types extensible
- Port interfaces adapter-independent

**External Validation:**
- 6 industry sources researched
- Patterns adopted with rationale
- Best practices applied

**Solid Domain:**
- Zero SOLID violations
- DDD patterns correctly applied
- Hexagonal architecture enforced
- Human confidence restored

---

## Final Words

Phase 7 is not just another phase. It's the foundation that everything else builds on. Get this right, and the next 6 months of development will be smooth. Get this wrong, and we'll be patching forever.

**The human is watching. The human is judging. The human expects excellence.**

**Deliver it.**
