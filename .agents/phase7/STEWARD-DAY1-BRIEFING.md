# Steward Agent - Day 1 Briefing

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Phase:** 7 - Jira Domain Architecture Review
**Your Role:** Lead Architect for Days 1-2
**Reporting To:** Director Agent
**Branch:** feature/jira-domain-redesign

---

## Your Mission

You are the lead architect for Phase 7 Days 1-2. Your mission is to **analyze the current Jira integration architecture** and **research industry best practices** to provide the intellectual foundation for redesign.

The human has lost confidence in our Jira integration. Phase 6.5 had a 75% failure rate. The human demands:

> "I DEMAND A THOROUGH REVIEW PHASE OF THE CURRENT JIRA SERVICE, JIRA ADAPTER. I WANT YOU TO QUESTION EVERYTHING IN THAT PHASE, THE DESIGN, ARE WE ROBUST ENOUGH? ARE WE PROVIDING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION AND DESIGN FOR FLEXIBILITY?"

> "THE DOMAIN MUST BE SOLID."

Your research and analysis will determine whether we rebuild correctly or continue patching forever.

**This is the most important architectural work in the project's lifecycle.**

## Day 1 Work Schedule

### Morning Session (4 hours): Current State Analysis

**Objective:** Analyze current architecture against SOLID, DDD, and Hexagonal principles.

**Required Reading:**
1. `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/docs/PHASE6.5-HANDOVER.md` - Understand what failed and why
2. `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/docs/PHASE7-JIRA-DOMAIN-REVIEW-SPEC.md` - Your mission parameters
3. `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/.agents/PHASE7-BRIEF.md` - Agent coordination guide

**Code to Analyze:**
1. `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/adapters/jira/jira_adapter.go` (1,137 lines - God object)
2. `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/core/domain/models.go` (Domain model)
3. `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/core/ports/jira_port.go` (Port interface)

**Analysis Framework:**

**SOLID Principles:**
- Single Responsibility: Does each component have one reason to change?
- Open/Closed: Can we add GitHub adapter without changing domain?
- Liskov Substitution: Can adapters be swapped transparently?
- Interface Segregation: Are interfaces focused and minimal?
- Dependency Inversion: Do high-level modules depend on abstractions?

**DDD Patterns:**
- Ubiquitous Language: Is terminology consistent?
- Bounded Contexts: Are boundaries clear?
- Aggregates: Are aggregate roots enforced?
- Value Objects: Are domain concepts immutable and validated?
- Repositories: Is persistence strategy clear?

**Hexagonal Architecture:**
- Domain Purity: Does domain have external dependencies?
- Port Ownership: Are ports defined by domain needs?
- Adapter Independence: Can adapters change without domain changes?
- Inside/Outside: Is the boundary clear?

**Deliverable:** `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/.agents/phase7/reports/current-state-analysis.md`

**Required Content:**
- Executive summary of violations (1 page)
- SOLID violations with code examples (3-4 pages)
- DDD violations with code examples (3-4 pages)
- Hexagonal violations with code examples (3-4 pages)
- Summary of root causes (1 page)

**Total:** 10-15 pages

**Quality Bar:**
- Every violation must have code example
- Code examples must be specific line ranges
- Explain WHY it's a violation, not just THAT it is
- Suggest what correct approach would be

2. How do they handle options and flexibility (functional options pattern)?
3. How do they implement pagination?
4. How do they use context for cancellation?
5. What are their request/response types?

**Method:**

1. How do they categorize errors (ErrorType)?
2. How do they handle idempotency?
3. What are their retry semantics?
4. How do they distinguish network vs business errors?
5. What is their error wrapping strategy?

**Method:**
- Clone repository or browse on GitHub
- Focus on `stripe/error.go` and retry logic
- Find examples of error categorization
- Understand retry/backoff implementation

**Required Examples:**
- Show `ErrorType` enum and categories

## Philosophical Guidance

### Question Everything

The human said: "QUESTION EVERYTHING IN THAT PHASE, THE DESIGN"

**What this means:**
- Don't assume current design is correct
- Don't assume Jira-centricity is required
- Don't assume string maps are inevitable
- Don't assume three repositories make sense
- Don't assume current field mapping is optimal

**Ask:**
- Why is it this way?
- Could we do it differently?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What would industry leaders do?
- What does DDD literature recommend?

### Be Rigorous

**Rigor means:**
- Citing specific code with line numbers
- Explaining WHY, not just WHAT
- Showing trade-offs, not just benefits
- Documenting alternatives considered
- Being honest about limitations

**Rigor does NOT mean:**
- Analysis paralysis (stick to timeline)
- Perfectionism (80/20 rule applies)
- Avoiding recommendations (be decisive)
- Hiding uncertainty (flag unknowns)

### Think in Principles

**Your North Star:**
- SOLID: Five principles, zero violations
- DDD: Ubiquitous language, aggregates, value objects
- Hexagonal: Domain independence, ports by use case

**Every recommendation must:**
- Align with these principles
- Have clear rationale
- Show how it fixes violations
- Enable future flexibility (GitHub adapter)

---

## You Are the Expert

**The Director trusts you** to lead the architectural analysis. This is your domain.

**You have authority to:**
- Define what constitutes a violation
- Recommend patterns to adopt
- Reject patterns that don't fit
- Request more time if critical (with justification)
- Challenge assumptions in current design

**You are accountable for:**
- Quality of analysis
- Depth of research
- Clarity of recommendations
- Meeting Day 1 deliverables

**The human's confidence depends on your rigor.**

---

## Final Reminders

1. **Write for the Human:** They will read this. Make it clear and compelling.
2. **Code Examples Required:** Every claim needs evidence.
3. **No Superficial Analysis:** "Looks fine" will be rejected.
4. **Honest Assessment:** If something is broken, say so.
5. **Decisive Recommendations:** ADOPT/ADAPT/REJECT, with rationale.
6. **Stick to Timeline:** 4 hours per session, deliver by end of day.
7. **Communicate Blockers:** Director is here to help.
