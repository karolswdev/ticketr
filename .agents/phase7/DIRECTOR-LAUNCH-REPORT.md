## External Validation Strategy

Your mandate: "ARE WE CHECKING THIS WITH HEADLESS VERSIONS OF GEMINI-CLI AND CODEX TO FIND OUT OTHER VIEWPOINTS ON THIS?"

**Our Approach:**

**6 Industry Sources (Steward Research, Days 1-2):**
1. **GitHub Octokit** (go-github library)
   - Resource-based API organization
   - Options pattern for flexibility
   - Pagination implementation

2. **Stripe Go SDK**
   - Error taxonomy (ErrorType categories)
   - Idempotency support
   - Retry semantics

3. **AWS SDK for Go v2**
   - Modular service clients
   - Configuration separation
   - Operation-specific types

4. **Linear API**
   - Issue modeling (GraphQL approach)
   - Type-safe client generation
   - Custom field handling

5. **Atlassian Connect Framework**
   - Jira extensibility patterns
   - Field discovery and metadata
   - Official Atlassian best practices

6. **DDD Literature**
   - Eric Evans: "Domain-Driven Design"
   - Vaughn Vernon: "Implementing DDD"
   - Martin Fowler: Enterprise patterns

**Deliverable:** 20+ page External Validation Report
- 3-5 pages per source
- Concrete code examples
- Pattern analysis (strengths, weaknesses, applicability)
- Clear recommendations (ADOPT/ADAPT/REJECT)

**We will not just trust ourselves. We will learn from the best.**

## Architecture Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility:** Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed:** Can add GitHub adapter without changing domain
- **Liskov Substitution:** Adapters are transparently swappable
- **Interface Segregation:** Interfaces are focused and minimal
- **Dependency Inversion:** High-level modules depend on abstractions

**Target:** ZERO violations in proposed design

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Consistent terminology across layers
- **Bounded Contexts:** Clear domain/integration boundaries
- **Aggregates:** Issue as aggregate root, consistency enforced
- **Value Objects:** Priority, Status, IssueType immutable and validated
- **Repositories:** Single source of truth, clear persistence

**Target:** 100% DDD patterns correctly applied

### Hexagonal Architecture
- **Domain Purity:** ZERO external dependencies in domain layer
- **Port Ownership:** Ports defined by domain needs, not adapter needs
- **Adapter Independence:** Domain never changes when adapters change
- **Clear Inside/Outside:** Dependency direction strictly enforced

**Target:** Domain has zero external dependencies

## Critical Questions Phase 7 Will Answer

**Domain Model:**
1. Should we call it "Issue" or "Ticket"?
2. Should external IDs be in domain or port layer?
3. Should CustomFields be strongly-typed or stringly-typed?
4. Should Priority be a value object or enum?

**Port Design:**
1. Should port be JiraPort or IssueTrackerPort?
2. Should port methods be CRUD or use case driven?
3. Should port expose JQL or abstract query language?
4. Should error taxonomy be in port or domain?

**Adapter Design:**
1. Should adapter be one class or multiple components?
2. Should field mapping be configuration or code?
3. Should metadata be cached or fetched per request?
4. Should HTTP/JSON be separated from domain conversion?

**Service Design:**
1. Should we have one service or multiple (Push, Pull, Sync)?
2. Should we support file + database or consolidate?
3. Should transaction boundaries be service level?
4. Should batch operations be in adapter or service?

**All questions answered with rationale documented in ADRs.**

## Human Approval Gate (Day 5)

**Before ANY implementation begins, you must approve:**
- [ ] Domain model design and rationale
- [ ] Port interface design and rationale
- [ ] Adapter architecture and component decomposition
- [ ] Service layer design and transaction boundaries
- [ ] Error handling taxonomy and retry strategy
- [ ] Migration plan (6 phases, 4 weeks, risks documented)
- [ ] Timeline and resource allocation

**Success Criteria for Approval:**
- You understand the proposed design
- You see clear rationale for all major decisions
- You see external validation backing our choices
- You see SOLID/DDD/Hexagonal compliance
- You see GitHub adapter can be added without domain changes
- You are confident the domain is solid

**You will explicitly state: "Confidence restored in Jira integration architecture"**

**OR you will request specific changes, and we will iterate.**

**NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK BEGINS WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL.**

---

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1: Analysis Paralysis**
- **Symptom:** Research never ends, timeline extends
- **Mitigation:** Strict timeline enforcement, 80/20 rule
- **Owner:** Director

**Risk 2: Superficial Validation**
- **Symptom:** "Looked at GitHub SDK, seems fine"
- **Mitigation:** Require 3-5 pages per source + code examples
- **Owner:** Director

**Risk 3: Timeline Slippage**
- **Symptom:** Day 5 arrives, deliverables incomplete
- **Mitigation:** Daily monitoring, early escalation to you
- **Owner:** Director

**Risk 4: Design Rejection**
- **Symptom:** You reject architecture on Day 5
- **Mitigation:** Multiple options shown, clear trade-offs, early feedback
- **Owner:** Director

**All risks actively monitored. You will be informed immediately if any materialize.**

---

## Success Metrics

**Phase 7 is successful when:**
- [ ] SOLID violations: 0 in proposed design
- [ ] DDD patterns correctly applied: 100%
- [ ] External patterns researched: 6+
- [ ] ADRs completed: 7
- [ ] Proposed design supports GitHub adapter without domain changes
- [ ] Error taxonomy covers all failure modes
- [ ] Human approves architecture
- [ ] Human states: "Confidence restored"

**Phase 7 is NOT successful until you explicitly approve.**

---

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups (Async)
- Steward reports end of each day
- Director reviews and provides feedback
- You receive progress updates

### Escalation Path
1. Agent blocked → Director resolves
2. Quality concern → Director reviews
3. Timeline slipping → Director escalates to you with options
4. Design conflict → Director + Steward decide, document

### Human Engagement Points
- **Day 2:** Optional early feedback session (if requested)
- **Day 5:** Mandatory Architecture Review Package presentation
- **Post-Approval:** Weekly implementation progress reports

---

## What This Means for v3.1.1

**Release Status:** BLOCKED

**Why:**
- Pull operation crashes (architectural issue, not tactical bug)
- Cosmic background not rendering (framework limitation or integration issue)
- Marquee not working (345 lines, zero output, integration broken)

**Only Modal ESC fix is working** (1 out of 4 critical fixes - 25% success rate)

**Shipping v3.1.1 with 75% critical failures is unacceptable.**

**New Timeline:**
- Phase 7 completion: 5 days (design + approval)
- Implementation: 4 weeks (if approved)
- v3.1.1 release: ~5 weeks from now (realistic estimate)

**Alternative:**
- Ship v3.1.0 with Modal ESC fix only (minor patch)
- Continue Phase 7 as planned
- Ship v3.2.0 with new Jira architecture (major release)

**Decision:** Your call. Recommend we proceed with Phase 7 regardless.

## Questions for You (Optional)

If you have time now, clarifications welcome:

1. **Timeline Flexibility:** If Day 5 reveals we need 1-2 extra days for critical research, is that acceptable?
2. **Interim Feedback:** Do you want Day 2 or Day 3 progress briefings, or just Day 5 final package?
3. **v3.1.1 Strategy:** Ship minor patch with just Modal fix, or wait for full Phase 7 implementation?
4. **External Validation Scope:** Are 6 sources sufficient, or do you want Gemini-CLI/Codex consultation as well?

**No rush on answers. Just flag if you have preferences.**
