## Risk & Issue Log

| Risk/Issue | Severity | Status | Mitigation | Owner |
|------------|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Analysis paralysis (research extends beyond Day 2) | MEDIUM | MONITORING | Strict timeline enforcement, 80/20 rule | Director |
| External validation superficial | HIGH | MONITORING | Require 3-5 pages per source + code examples | Director |
| Timeline slippage | MEDIUM | MONITORING | Daily standups, early escalation to human | Director |
| Human rejects design | HIGH | MITIGATING | Multiple options shown, clear trade-offs, early feedback | Director |

---

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standup (Async)

**Format:**
```
Agent: [Name]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Yesterday: [What was completed]
Today: [What will be worked on]
Blockers: [Any issues preventing progress]
Deliverables: [What will be delivered today]
```

### Escalation Path

1. Agent blocked → Report to Director immediately
2. Quality concern → Director reviews and provides feedback
3. Timeline slipping → Director escalates to human with options
4. Design conflict → Director + Steward decide, document rationale

---

**Phase 7 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] SOLID violations: 0 in proposed design
- [ ] DDD patterns correctly applied: 100%
- [ ] External patterns researched: 6+
- [ ] ADRs completed: 7
