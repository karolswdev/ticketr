### Technical Debt Resolved ✅

All P0 issues from Week 2 assessment have been **RESOLVED**:

1. ~~Global Theme State~~ → **FIXED** (Elm Architecture compliant)
2. ~~Test Coverage 21.4%~~ → **FIXED** (82.8%, +61.4pp)
3. ~~No Service Mocking~~ → **FIXED** (Comprehensive mocks)
4. ~~No Help Screen~~ → **FIXED** (94.5% coverage)
5. ~~Static Spinner~~ → **FIXED** (Animated with bubbles/spinner)
6. ~~Theme Inconsistency~~ → **FIXED** (All components theme-aware)
7. ~~No Terminal Validation~~ → **FIXED** (80×24 minimum)
