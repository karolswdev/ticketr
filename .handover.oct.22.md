# Ticketr Bubbletea TUI Refactor - Handover Document
**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Phase:** Week 2 Complete, Week 3 Ready to Start
**Branch:** `feature/bubbletea-refactor`
**Status:** ✅ Approved with Conditions (7.5/10)

---

## Executive Summary

We have successfully completed **Week 2** of a clean-slate Bubbletea TUI refactor for Ticketr. The foundation is solid, core views are implemented, and specialized agent reviews have identified critical issues that must be addressed before proceeding to Week 3.

**Current State:**
- 29 Go files, 4,072 lines of code
- Real data integration (workspace + ticket services)
- Virtualized tree component (handles 10,000+ items)
- Detail view with scrollable viewport
- Workspace selector with modal system
- 3 themes (Default/Green, Dark/Blue, Arctic/Cyan)
- 20/20 tests passing (but only 21.4% coverage)

**Next Phase:** Fix critical issues (2-3 days), then proceed with Week 3 features.

---

## Methodology Used

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Strategy

We used a **specialized agent approach** with clear role separation:

#### **Builder Agent** (Feature Development)
- **Role:** Implements features according to specifications
- **Deliverables:** Working code, basic tests, documentation
- **Used for:** Week 1 (foundation), Week 2 Days 1-5 (core views)

#### **Verifier Agent** (Quality Assurance)
- **Role:** Tests coverage, performance benchmarks, code quality audits
- **Deliverables:** Verification reports with test results and metrics
- **Used for:** Week 2 final review

#### **Steward Agent** (Architectural Oversight)
- **Role:** Architecture review, plan adherence, dependency audits
- **Deliverables:** Architectural assessments, technical debt reports
- **Used for:** Week 2 architectural review

#### **TUIUX Agent** (User Experience)
- **Role:** Visual consistency, accessibility, keyboard navigation, wireframe compliance
- **Deliverables:** UX review reports with actionable improvements
- **Used for:** Week 2 UX review

#### **Director Agent** (Strategic Oversight)
- **Role:** Synthesizes all reviews, makes go/no-go decisions, plans next phases
- **Deliverables:** Final assessments, week planning, resource allocation
- **Used for:** Week 2 final assessment and Week 3 planning

### 2. Parallel Task Delegation

**Key Pattern:** Launch multiple agents in parallel for independent work:

```bash
# Example: Launch 3 agents simultaneously
Task(builder, "Implement feature X")
Task(verifier, "Test feature Y")
Task(tuiux, "Review design Z")
# All run concurrently
```

This dramatically reduces wall-clock time (days → hours).

### 3. Quality Gates

After each major phase (Week 1, Week 2, etc.):
1. **Builder** delivers implementation
2. **Verifier** audits quality (tests, performance, security)
3. **Steward** reviews architecture (patterns, scalability, debt)
4. **TUIUX** evaluates user experience (visual, interaction, accessibility)
5. **Director** synthesizes findings and makes go/no-go decision

### 4. Documentation-First Approach

Every major decision documented BEFORE coding:
- Architecture docs (OPTIMAL_COMPONENT_STRATEGY.md)
- Wireframes (TUI_WIREFRAMES.md)
- Plans (CLEAN_SLATE_REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md)

This ensures alignment and reduces rework.

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working Well ✅

1. **Performance:** Tree component renders 1,000 items in 3.15 µs (target: <16ms) - **exceeds by 5,000x**
2. **Architecture:** Clean separation, proper Bubbletea patterns, no callback hell
3. **Components:** Tree, detail view, workspace selector all functional
4. **Data Integration:** Real workspace and ticket data loading
5. **Focus Management:** Tab navigation, keyboard shortcuts working
6. **Themes:** 3 beautiful themes (Default, Dark, Arctic)

### Critical Issues Identified ⚠️

#### **P0 - Must Fix Before Week 3 (Blocking):**

1. **Global Theme State Violation** (Verifier)
   - **Issue:** Theme uses global `var current` - violates Bubbletea patterns
   - **File:** `internal/tui-bubbletea/theme/theme.go:85-86`
   - **Fix:** Move theme into Model struct
   - **Effort:** 2-4 hours
   - **Impact:** Breaks Elm Architecture, prevents proper testing

2. **Test Coverage Too Low** (Verifier)
   - **Current:** 21.4% (target: 60% minimum, 80% ideal)
   - **Missing:** Model tests, Update tests, View tests, Command tests
   - **Effort:** 8-12 hours
   - **Impact:** Cannot validate correctness, regressions likely

3. **No Service Mocking Infrastructure** (Verifier)
   - **Issue:** Cannot test with mock services
   - **Impact:** Integration tests skipped (2 of 7)
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours
   - **Fix:** Create mock implementations of WorkspaceService, TicketQueryService

4. **No Help Screen** (TUIUX)
   - **Issue:** Users cannot discover features (`?` key does nothing)
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Impact:** Poor discoverability

5. **Static Spinner** (TUIUX)
   - **Issue:** Loading animation not implemented (shows static "Loading...")
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Impact:** Poor feedback during async operations

6. **Theme Inconsistency** (TUIUX)
   - **Issue:** Tree and modal components have hardcoded colors
   - **Files:** `components/tree/styles.go`, `components/modal/modal.go`
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours
   - **Impact:** Themes don't apply consistently

7. **No Terminal Size Validation** (TUIUX)
   - **Issue:** Will break on small terminals (< 80×24)
   - **Effort:** 1 hour
   - **Impact:** Crashes or corrupted display on small terminals

#### **P1 - High Priority (Fix During Week 3):**

8. **Action System Foundation Missing** (Steward)
   - **Issue:** Needed for command palette (Week 3 Day 3)
   - **Effort:** 2 days
   - **Impact:** Week 3 blocked without this
   - **Reference:** EXTENSIBLE_ACTION_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md

9. **Modal System Incomplete** (Steward)
   - **Issue:** Centering, size constraints, backdrop dismissal not polished
   - **Effort:** 1 day
   - **Impact:** Week 3 modals will look inconsistent

10. **Workspace Switch Not Wired** (Verifier)
    - **Issue:** Workspace selector shows modal but doesn't reload tickets
    - **File:** `update.go:123-128` (TODO comment)
    - **Effort:** 2 hours
    - **Impact:** Core feature incomplete

### Summary of Effort Required

**P0 Issues (Must Fix):** 20-26 hours (~2-3 days)
**P1 Issues (Should Fix):** 24 hours (~3 days)
**Total:** 44-50 hours (~5-6 days)

**Recommendation:** Allocate 3 days to fix P0 issues, address P1 during Week 3.

### Key Files to Understand

**Root Application:**
- `app.go` - Creates Bubbletea program
- `model.go` - Root state (⚠️ needs theme field added)
- `update.go` - Message routing (⚠️ 0% coverage)
- `view.go` - Layout rendering (⚠️ 0% coverage)

**Critical Components:**
- `components/tree/tree.go` - 266 lines, handles 10,000+ items efficiently
- `views/detail/detail.go` - 224 lines, scrollable ticket detail
- `views/workspace/workspace.go` - 113 lines, workspace selector

**Problem Areas:**
- `theme/theme.go:85-86` - Global state (MUST FIX)
- `components/loading.go` - Static spinner (SHOULD FIX)
- `actions/` - Empty directory (P1 PRIORITY)

---

## How to Orchestrate Next Steps

### Option A: Fix Critical Issues First (Recommended)

**Timeline:** 3 days
**Risk:** Low
**Outcome:** Solid foundation for Week 3+

#### Day 1: Fix Bubbletea Anti-Patterns

**Delegate to Builder:**
```markdown
Fix global theme state and service mocking.

TASKS:
1. Move theme into Model struct
   - Remove global `var current` in theme/theme.go
   - Add `theme Theme` field to Model
   - Pass theme to all components via Update
   - Update all theme.Get() calls to use m.theme

2. Create service mocks
   - internal/tui-bubbletea/mocks/services.go
   - Mock WorkspaceService
   - Mock TicketQueryService
   - Update tests to use mocks

ACCEPTANCE:
- No global state in theme system
- Integration tests passing (7/7, up from 5/7)
- Can test with mock data
```

#### Day 2: Add Missing Components

**Delegate to Builder:**
```markdown
Implement help screen and animated spinner.

TASKS:
1. Help screen component
   - components/help/help.go
   - Parse keybindings from action registry
   - Modal overlay with scrollable content
   - Triggered by '?' key

2. Animated spinner
   - Use bubbles/spinner component
   - Update loading.go to use spinner.Model
   - Add to loading states (workspace load, ticket load)

3. Terminal size validation
   - Check width >= 80, height >= 24 in Init()
   - Show error if too small
   - Suggest resize

ACCEPTANCE:
- Press '?' shows help
- Loading shows animated spinner
- Small terminal shows clear error
```

#### Day 3: Theme Consistency & Tests

**Delegate to Builder + Verifier in parallel:**

**Builder:**
```markdown
Fix theme consistency across all components.

TASKS:
1. Update tree/styles.go
   - Remove hardcoded colors
   - Accept theme parameter
   - Use theme.Primary, theme.Border, etc.

2. Update modal/modal.go
   - Remove hardcoded colors
   - Use theme system

3. Wire workspace switching
   - Complete TODO in update.go:123-128
   - LoadTickets command on workspace switch
   - Clear tree and reload

ACCEPTANCE:
- All 3 themes apply consistently
- Workspace switching reloads tickets
- No hardcoded colors remain
```

**Verifier (parallel):**
```markdown
Boost test coverage to 60%.

TASKS:
1. Add model tests
   - Test Init() returns correct commands
   - Test state initialization

2. Add update tests
   - Test message routing
   - Test focus management
   - Test data loading messages

3. Add view tests
   - Test rendering with different states
   - Test layout calculations

4. Add command tests
   - Test LoadCurrentWorkspace
   - Test LoadTickets
   - Test error handling

ACCEPTANCE:
- Coverage ≥ 60%
- All critical paths tested
- go test -race passes
```

**After Day 3:** Review with Verifier. If coverage ≥60% and P0 issues fixed, proceed to Week 3.

---

### Option B: Week 3 with Parallel Fixes (Riskier)

**Timeline:** Week 3 features + ongoing fixes
**Risk:** Medium (technical debt compounds)
**Outcome:** Faster feature delivery, messier codebase

#### Approach:
- Start Week 3 Day 1 with search modal implementation
- Assign separate Builder to fix P0 issues in parallel
- Merge fixes as they complete
- Risk: Integration conflicts, testing complexity

**Not recommended** due to global state issue - it will cause bugs in new features.

---

### Week 3 Plan (After Fixes)

From **WEEK2_FINAL_ASSESSMENT.md**, Week 3 includes:

**Day 1 (After fixes):** Action system foundation
**Day 2:** Search modal with fuzzy finding
**Day 3:** Command palette (Ctrl+P)
**Day 4:** Help modal context-aware improvements
**Day 5:** Polish and verification

**Delegate to Builder for each day with detailed specs from CLEAN_SLATE_REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md**

---

## How to Delegate Tasks

### Pattern 1: Single Agent, Single Task

```markdown
Task(builder, "Implement search modal")

Prompt:
You are implementing Week 3 Day 2: Search Modal.

CONTEXT:
- Read: CLEAN_SLATE_REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md Week 3 section
- Read: TUI_WIREFRAMES.md search modal wireframe
- Code: internal/tui-bubbletea/

YOUR MISSION:
[Detailed task description with acceptance criteria]

DELIVERABLES:
1. Component implementation
2. Tests (aim for 80% coverage)
3. Integration with main model
```

### Pattern 2: Multiple Agents, Parallel Tasks

```markdown
# Launch all in one message:
Task(builder, "Implement feature X")
Task(verifier, "Create performance benchmarks")
Task(tuiux, "Review modal designs")

# All execute concurrently
```

### Pattern 3: Review Gate

```markdown
# After major phase:
Task(verifier, "Week N verification report")
Task(steward, "Week N architectural review")
Task(tuiux, "Week N UX review")
Task(director, "Week N final assessment")

# Director synthesizes and makes go/no-go decision
```

---

## Agent Prompting Best Practices

### 1. Always Provide Context

```markdown
CONTEXT:
- Branch: feature/bubbletea-refactor
- Phase: Week 3 Day 2
- Dependencies: Week 2 complete, P0 issues fixed
- Read: [specific documents]
```

### 2. Clear Deliverables

```markdown
DELIVERABLES:
1. ✅ Component X implemented
2. ✅ Tests with 80%+ coverage
3. ✅ Integration tests passing
4. ✅ Documentation updated
```

### 3. Acceptance Criteria

```markdown
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Feature works end-to-end
- No regressions (all existing tests pass)
- Performance within budget
- Code follows project patterns
```

### 4. Reference Documents

Always point to:
- Master plan for overall context
- Specific design docs for implementation details
- Wireframes for visual targets
- Previous reports for context

---

## Quality Gates

### Every Feature:
1. Builder implements with basic tests
2. Feature compiles and runs
3. Manual testing shows it works

### Every Week:
1. Verifier audits (coverage, performance, quality)
2. Steward reviews architecture
3. TUIUX evaluates user experience
4. Director decides go/no-go

### Never Proceed If:
- Critical bugs found
- Test coverage drops
- Architecture violations introduced
- UX regressions detected

---

## Git Workflow

### Current Branch
```bash
feature/bubbletea-refactor
```

### Commit Strategy

**After each day:**
```bash
git add internal/tui-bubbletea/
git commit -m "feat(tui): implement [feature] (Week X Day Y)

- Added [component]
- Tests: X/Y passing
- Coverage: Z%

Part of clean-slate Bubbletea refactor.
See CLEAN_SLATE_REFACTOR_MASTER_PLAN.md"
```

**After each week:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(tui): complete Week X - [theme]

Week X deliverables:
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

Quality scores:
- Verifier: X/10
- Steward: Y/10
- TUIUX: Z/10

See WEEKX_FINAL_ASSESSMENT.md"
```

### Merge Strategy

**DO NOT merge to main until:**
- Week 17 complete (full feature parity)
- All quality gates passed
- Beta testing successful
- Director approval

**When ready:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feature/bubbletea-refactor
git tag -a v3.2.0 -m "Bubbletea TUI refactor complete"
```

```bash
go test ./internal/tui-bubbletea/... -v
go test ./internal/tui-bubbletea/... -race
```

### Coverage Check
```bash
go test ./internal/tui-bubbletea/... -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### Review Documents
```bash
# All in root directory:
cat WEEK2_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
cat WEEK2_ARCHITECTURAL_REVIEW.md
cat WEEK2_UX_REVIEW.md
cat WEEK2_FINAL_ASSESSMENT.md
```

---

## Next Session Prompts

### If Starting Fresh

```markdown
I'm continuing the Ticketr Bubbletea refactor from the handover document.

Please read .handover.oct.22.md and summarize:
1. Current state
2. Critical issues to fix
3. Recommended next steps

Then await my decision on Option A (fix issues) or Option B (proceed to Week 3).
```

### If Resuming After Fixes

```markdown
I've completed the P0 fixes from .handover.oct.22.md.

Please:
1. Verify fixes with Verifier agent
2. Run coverage check (should be ≥60%)
3. If passing, start Week 3 Day 1 (action system foundation)
```

### If Need Quick Context

```markdown
Show me the tree component implementation and explain how virtualization works.
```

---

## Critical Paths to Success

### Must Not Break:
1. **Bubbletea patterns** - Pure functions, no globals, commands for async
2. **Test coverage** - Always trend upward, never let it drop
3. **Performance budget** - Tree must stay <16ms render time
4. **Architecture** - Component boundaries, message flow, separation of concerns

### Must Complete:
1. **Action system** (Week 3) - Enables all future extensibility
2. **Search/Command palette** (Week 3) - Core UX features
3. **Sync integration** (Week 4) - Real Jira sync
4. **Visual polish** (Week 5) - Animations, themes, effects

### Success Criteria for v3.2.0:
- All features from Tview version working
- Performance better than Tview (60 FPS)
- Test coverage >80%
- Zero critical bugs
- User satisfaction >80%

## Final Recommendations

1. **Fix P0 issues first** (Option A) - 3 days well spent
2. **Maintain quality gates** - Never skip reviews
3. **Document decisions** - Update .handover after each week
4. **Test continuously** - Don't accumulate test debt
5. **Trust the process** - The multi-agent approach works

**You're building something LEGENDARY. Take the time to do it right.**
