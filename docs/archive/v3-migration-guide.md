## Migration Strategy

The migration is designed to be **progressive** and **reversible**. You can enable features gradually and roll back if needed.

### Phase 1: Alpha (SQLite Only)
Enable the SQLite backend while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### Phase 2: Beta (SQLite + Workspaces)
Add multi-workspace support for managing multiple projects.

### Phase 3: RC (SQLite + Workspaces + TUI)
Enable the Terminal User Interface for interactive management.

### Phase 4: Stable (All Features)
Full v3.0 experience with all features enabled.

---

## Quick Start Migration

### Step 1: Check Current Status

```bash
# Check your current setup
ticketr v3 status
```

### Step 2: Enable Alpha Features

```bash
# Enable SQLite backend
ticketr v3 enable alpha
```

### Step 3: Migrate Existing Projects

```bash
# Migrate current directory
ticketr v3 migrate

# Migrate specific directory
ticketr v3 migrate ~/projects

# Preview migration (dry-run)
ticketr v3 migrate --dry-run

# Migrate all projects from home
ticketr v3 migrate --all
```

### Step 4: Verify Migration

```bash
# Check migration status
ticketr v3 status

# Test with existing commands
ticketr push tickets.md
ticketr pull --project PROJ
```

---

## Detailed Migration Steps

### 1. Pre-Migration Checklist

Before migrating, ensure:
- [ ] All tickets are synced with JIRA
- [ ] `.ticketr.state` files are not corrupted
- [ ] You have backups of important ticket files
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set

### 2. Understanding the Migration Process

The migration tool will:
1. Scan for `.ticketr.state` files
2. Create SQLite database at `~/.local/share/ticketr/ticketr.db`
3. Convert state entries to database records
4. Parse associated Markdown files
5. Create workspace entries for each project
6. Backup original state files with `.backup-{timestamp}` suffix

### 3. Migration Commands

#### Basic Migration
```bash
# Migrate current directory
ticketr v3 migrate

# Output:
# Starting migration from: .
# Found project at: /home/user/backend
# Created workspace 'backend' for project at /home/user/backend
# Migrated 45 tickets from .ticketr.state
```

#### Batch Migration
```bash
# Migrate all projects in a directory
ticketr v3 migrate ~/projects

# Migrate everything from home directory
ticketr v3 migrate --all
```

#### Dry Run Mode
```bash
# Preview what will be migrated without making changes
ticketr v3 migrate --dry-run

# Verbose output for debugging
ticketr v3 migrate --verbose
```

### 4. Post-Migration Verification

After migration, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check database status
ticketr v3 status

# List migrated workspaces (Phase 2+)
ticketr v3 workspace list

# Test push/pull operations
ticketr push tickets.md
ticketr pull --project PROJ
```

## Feature Flags

### Environment Variables

Control features via environment variables:

```bash
export TICKETR_USE_SQLITE=true        # Enable SQLite backend
export TICKETR_ENABLE_WORKSPACES=true # Enable workspaces
export TICKETR_ENABLE_TUI=true        # Enable TUI
export TICKETR_AUTO_MIGRATE=true      # Auto-migrate on first run
export TICKETR_VERBOSE=true           # Verbose logging
```

### Configuration File

Or use `.ticketr.yaml`:

```yaml
features:
  use_sqlite: true
  sqlite_path: ~/.local/share/ticketr/ticketr.db
  enable_workspaces: false
  enable_tui: false
  auto_migrate: false
  verbose_logging: false
```

---

## Progressive Feature Enablement

### Alpha Phase (Weeks 1-4)
```bash
# Enable alpha features
ticketr v3 enable alpha

# What's enabled:
# ✓ SQLite backend
# ✓ Automatic migration
# ✗ Workspaces
# ✗ TUI
```

### Beta Phase (Weeks 5-8)
```bash
# Enable beta features
ticketr v3 enable beta

# What's enabled:
# ✓ SQLite backend
# ✓ Workspaces
# ✓ Automatic migration
# ✗ TUI
```

### RC Phase (Weeks 9-16)
```bash
# Enable RC features
ticketr v3 enable rc

# What's enabled:
# ✓ SQLite backend
# ✓ Workspaces
# ✓ TUI
# ✓ All features except auto-migration
```

### Stable Release
```bash
# Enable all stable features
ticketr v3 enable stable

# All v3.0 features enabled
# Auto-migration disabled for safety
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Maintaining v2.x Workflow

Even with v3.0 features enabled, all v2.x commands continue to work:

```bash
# These commands work exactly as before
ticketr push tickets.md
ticketr pull --project PROJ
ticketr schema
```

### File-Based State

The SQLite adapter maintains compatibility with file-based workflows:
- Reads from Markdown files
- Writes back to Markdown files
- Syncs with database transparently
- `.ticketr.state` files are preserved (but not used)

### Rollback Procedure

If you need to rollback to v2.x:

```bash
# Disable v3 features
export TICKETR_USE_SQLITE=false

# Or via config
features:
  use_sqlite: false

# Restore state files from backup
mv .ticketr.state.backup-* .ticketr.state

# Continue using v2.x
ticketr push tickets.md
```

## Directory Structure

### v2.x Structure
```
project/
├── tickets.md
├── .ticketr.state
├── .env
└── .ticketr.yaml
```

### v3.0 Structure
```
~/.config/ticketr/
├── config.yaml         # Global configuration
└── workspaces.yaml     # Workspace definitions

~/.local/share/ticketr/
├── ticketr.db         # SQLite database
├── templates/         # Ticket templates
└── backups/          # State file backups

~/.cache/ticketr/
├── jira_schema.json  # Cached field mappings
└── logs/            # Operation logs

project/              # Your project directory
├── tickets.md       # Still works the same!
└── .env            # Project-specific config (optional)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Migration Fails
```bash
Error: failed to create SQLite adapter: database is locked
```
**Solution:** Ensure no other ticketr process is running.

#### State File Not Found
```bash
Error: No .ticketr.state file found
```
**Solution:** This project hasn't been used with ticketr before. No migration needed.

#### Permission Denied
```bash
Error: failed to create database directory: permission denied
```
**Solution:** Check permissions on `~/.local/share/ticketr/` or set custom path:
```bash
export TICKETR_SQLITE_PATH=/custom/path/ticketr.db
```

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if SQLite is working
ticketr v3 status

# Test database connection
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/ticketr/ticketr.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tickets;"

# Check migration logs
cat ~/.cache/ticketr/logs/migration-*.log
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Run with verbose flag: `ticketr v3 migrate --verbose`
2. Check logs in `~/.cache/ticketr/logs/`
3. Report issues at: https://github.com/karolswdev/ticketr/issues

## FAQ

### Q: Will my existing Markdown files still work?
**A:** Yes! The Markdown format remains unchanged. v3.0 adds a database layer for state management but still reads and writes the same Markdown format.

### Q: Can I use v3.0 features selectively?
**A:** Yes! Features can be enabled individually via feature flags. You can use just the SQLite backend without workspaces or TUI.

### Q: Is the migration reversible?
**A:** Yes! Original state files are backed up, and you can disable v3.0 features at any time to return to v2.x behavior.

### Q: Do I need to migrate all projects at once?
**A:** No! You can migrate projects individually or in batches. Unmigrated projects continue to work with v2.x.

### Q: Will this affect my CI/CD pipelines?
**A:** No! The CLI interface remains the same. Existing scripts and pipelines will continue to work without modification.

### Q: How much disk space does the database use?
**A:** The SQLite database is very efficient. For 1000 tickets, expect about 500KB-1MB of disk usage.
