## Objective

**Primary Goal:** Design a robust, flexible, and principled Jira domain integration architecture that restores human confidence and enables future multi-tracker support (GitHub, Linear, etc.).

**Specific Objectives:**

1. **Eliminate Architectural Debt**
   - Fix SOLID principles violations
   - Apply Domain-Driven Design patterns correctly
   - Implement proper Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

2. **Create System-Agnostic Abstractions**
   - Domain model works for any issue tracker (not just Jira)
   - Port interfaces defined by domain needs, not adapter implementation
   - Support for future GitHub/Linear adapters without domain changes

3. **Establish Robust Error Handling**
   - Typed error taxonomy (retryable vs fatal, categories)
   - Clear retry semantics
   - Network vs business error distinction

4. **Enable Testability**
   - Proper dependency injection
   - Contract tests for adapters
   - Mockable interfaces
   - Integration tests with real services

5. **Validate Through External Sources**
   - Research industry best practices (GitHub Octokit, Stripe SDK, AWS SDK)
   - Consult DDD literature (Evans, Vernon, Fowler)
   - Document rationale for all decisions

6. **Restore Human Confidence**
   - Demonstrate rigorous analysis
   - Show external validation
   - Provide clear migration path
   - Prove architecture is solid before implementation

---

## Methodology

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach

**Step 1: Ubiquitous Language**
- Identify core domain concepts
- Define consistent terminology across layers
- Document glossary
- Ensure team alignment

**Step 2: Bounded Contexts**
- Define clear boundaries between domain and integration
- Identify context maps
- Document relationships

**Step 3: Aggregates**
- Identify aggregate roots (Ticket/Issue)
- Define consistency boundaries
- Document invariants
- Establish transaction boundaries

**Step 4: Value Objects**
- Create immutable value objects for all domain concepts
- Implement validation logic
- Document equality semantics

**Step 5: Repositories**
- Design aggregate-based repositories
- Define persistence strategies
- Document query patterns

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

**Inside (Domain):**
- Pure business logic
- No external dependencies
- Framework-agnostic
- Technology-agnostic

**Ports (Interfaces):**
- Defined by domain needs
- System-agnostic abstractions
- Use case driven
- Adapter-independent

**Adapters (Implementations):**
- Technology-specific implementations
- Depend on ports, not domain
- Interchangeable
- Testable in isolation

**Direction of Dependencies:**
```
Adapters → Ports → Domain
(Outside)  (Interface)  (Inside)

Domain NEVER depends on adapters
Ports defined by domain use cases
Adapters implement ports
```

### SOLID Principles Validation

**Single Responsibility:**
- Each class/module has one reason to change
- Separate concerns: HTTP, serialization, mapping, business logic

**Open/Closed:**
- Open for extension (new adapters, new field types)
- Closed for modification (domain doesn't change when adding adapters)

**Liskov Substitution:**
- Any IssueTrackerPort implementation is substitutable
- GitHub adapter works anywhere Jira adapter works

**Interface Segregation:**
- Clients don't depend on methods they don't use
- Split large interfaces into focused ones

**Dependency Inversion:**
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- Both depend on abstractions (ports)

---

## Architecture Principles

### Principle 1: Domain Purity

**Rule:** The domain layer has ZERO external dependencies.

**What This Means:**
- No `JiraID` field in domain (use `ExternalID` with system identifier)
- No Jira-specific concepts in domain model
- No HTTP, JSON, database libraries in domain
- Domain models can be unit tested in isolation

**Validation:**
```bash
# Domain package should have no external imports
go list -f '{{.Deps}}' ./internal/core/domain | grep -v "internal/core"
# Should be empty or only stdlib
```

### Principle 2: Port Abstraction Consistency

**Rule:** Ports define abstractions at consistent levels, driven by domain use cases.

**What This Means:**
- All port methods are high-level operations (CreateIssue, QueryIssues)
- No low-level operations mixed in (GetIssueTypeFields)
- No technology-specific terms (JQL) in port interfaces
- Ports can be implemented by any issue tracking system

**Example:**
```go
// GOOD: System-agnostic, use case driven
type IssueTracker interface {
    CreateIssue(ctx context.Context, req *CreateIssueRequest) (*Issue, error)
    QueryIssues(ctx context.Context, query *IssueQuery) (*IssueQueryResult, error)
}

// BAD: Jira-specific, mixed abstraction levels
type JiraPort interface {
    CreateTicket(ticket Ticket) (string, error)
    GetIssueTypeFields(issueTypeName string) (map[string]interface{}, error)
    SearchTickets(ctx context.Context, jql string, ...) ([]Ticket, error)
}
```

### Principle 3: Strong Typing Over String Maps

**Rule:** Use strongly-typed value objects instead of `map[string]string` or `map[string]interface{}`.

**What This Means:**
- Custom fields are typed (TextField, NumberField, DateField, etc.)
- Validation at domain level (compile-time > runtime > no validation)
- Clear semantics (Priority.High vs "High" string)

**Example:**
```go
// GOOD: Strongly typed
type Priority struct {
    level int // 1=Critical, 2=High, 3=Medium, 4=Low
}

type CustomField interface {
    Name() string
    Value() interface{}
    Validate() error
}

type StoryPointsField struct {
    points int
}

// BAD: Stringly typed
type Ticket struct {
    CustomFields map[string]string // "Story Points": "5"
}
```

### Principle 4: Error Taxonomy

**Rule:** All errors are typed with clear categories, retry semantics, and cause chains.

**What This Means:**
- Distinguish retryable from fatal errors
- Network errors vs business validation errors
- Rate limiting with retry-after duration
- Error wrapping preserves context

**Example:**
```go
type ErrorCategory int

const (
    ErrorCategoryAuth ErrorCategory = iota
    ErrorCategoryNetwork
    ErrorCategoryRateLimit
    ErrorCategoryValidation
    ErrorCategoryNotFound
    ErrorCategoryConflict
    ErrorCategoryInternal
)

type TrackerError struct {
    Category   ErrorCategory
    Message    string
    Retryable  bool
    RetryAfter *time.Duration
    Cause      error
}
```

### Principle 5: Testability Through Dependency Injection

**Rule:** All dependencies are injected, all interfaces are mockable, all components are testable in isolation.

**What This Means:**
- No global state or singletons
- HTTP client injected, not embedded
- Configuration separate from client
- Contract tests validate adapter behavior

**Example:**
```go
// GOOD: Dependencies injected
type JiraAdapter struct {
    transport  HTTPTransport      // Interface, mockable
    serializer Serializer         // Interface, mockable
    mapper     FieldMapper        // Interface, mockable
    metadata   MetadataCache      // Interface, mockable
}

// BAD: Dependencies embedded
type JiraAdapter struct {
    client *http.Client           // Concrete, hard to mock
    baseURL string
    // ... everything in one struct
}
```

---

## Branch Strategy

### Branch: feature/jira-domain-redesign

**Purpose:**
- All Phase 7 design work happens here
- All ADRs committed here
- All specifications committed here
- All prototypes committed here
- NO production code (throwaway exploration only)

**Workflow:**

1. **Create Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main  # or feature/v3
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/jira-domain-redesign
   git push -u origin feature/jira-domain-redesign
   ```

2. **Work in Branch:**
   - All agents commit deliverables to this branch
   - Commit often with clear messages
   - Format: `docs(phase7): Add ADR-001 Issue Tracker Abstraction`

3. **Review & Approval:**
   - Director compiles all deliverables
   - Human reviews on this branch
   - Human provides approval or change requests

4. **Merge After Approval:**
   ```bash
   # Only after human approval
   git checkout main  # or feature/v3
   git merge --no-ff feature/jira-domain-redesign
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Implementation Branches:**
   - After merge and approval, create implementation branches
   - Format: `feature/jira-domain-impl-phase7.1`
   - Each implementation phase gets its own branch

**Protection Rules:**
- No direct commits to main
- Requires human approval before merge
- All ADRs must be reviewed before merge
- All design docs finalized before merge

**Commit Message Format:**
```
docs(phase7): [type] [brief description]

[Optional: detailed explanation]

Deliverable: [which deliverable this contributes to]
Agent: [who created this]
```

Examples:
- `docs(phase7): Add Current State SOLID Analysis`
- `docs(phase7): Add External Validation GitHub Octokit Analysis`
- `docs(phase7): Add ADR-002 Domain Model Design`
- `docs(phase7): Add Domain Model Prototype`

---

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Analysis Paralysis

**Symptom:** Research never ends, no decisions made, timeline extends indefinitely

**Mitigation:**
- Strict timeline: Day 1-2 research only, Day 3-4 design only, Day 5 decision only
- Director enforces: No extending timeline without human approval
- Deliverable deadlines are firm
- "Good enough" analysis is acceptable (80/20 rule)

**Escalation:**
- If Day 2 ends without External Validation Report complete: Director escalates to human
- Human decides: Extend by 1 day OR proceed with current research

---

### Risk 2: Premature Implementation

**Symptom:** Builder starts coding production features before design approved

**Mitigation:**
- Director enforces: NO production code in Phase 7
- Only throwaway prototypes allowed (clearly marked as such)
- Human approval required before ANY implementation phase begins
- Branch protection prevents accidental production commits

**Escalation:**
- If Builder commits production code: Director rejects and requests revert
- Builder refocuses on design and prototypes only

---

### Risk 3: External Validation is Superficial

**Symptom:** "Looked at GitHub SDK, seems fine" without deep analysis

**Mitigation:**
- Steward must document: What pattern? Why relevant? How to adopt? Trade-offs?
- Director reviews validation depth before accepting
- Each pattern requires 3-5 page analysis minimum
- Code examples required, not just descriptions

**Escalation:**
- If validation lacks depth: Director rejects and requests deeper analysis
- If pattern not applicable: Steward must document why and find alternative source

---

### Risk 4: Human Rejects Design

**Symptom:** Day 5 human review rejects architecture, must start over

**Mitigation:**
- Director presents multiple options where uncertain
- Steward documents rationale for all decisions
- Show trade-offs explicitly (not just "this is best")
- Solicit human input on Day 2-3 for early feedback

**Escalation:**
- If human rejects design: Extend Phase 7 by 2 days, iterate on feedback
- Director captures specific rejection reasons
- Builder revises design based on feedback
- Repeat Day 5 approval process

---

### Risk 5: Timeline Slips

**Symptom:** Day 5 arrives but deliverables incomplete

**Mitigation:**
- Daily standup (async) to track progress
- Director monitors deliverable completion
- Red flag if Day 2 ends without validation report
- Adjust scope if needed (defer non-critical ADRs)

**Escalation:**
- If timeline slipping: Director proposes to human:
  - Option A: Extend by 1-2 days
  - Option B: Reduce scope (defer some ADRs to Phase 7.1)
  - Option C: Parallelize more work
- Human decides which option

**Week 2:**
- Phase 7.2: Port layer completion (Day 1)
- Phase 7.3: Jira adapter rewrite (Days 2-5)

**Week 3:**
- Phase 7.3: Jira adapter completion (Days 1-2)
- Phase 7.4: Service layer migration (Days 3-5)

**Week 4:**
- Phase 7.4: Service layer completion (Days 1-2)
- Phase 7.5: Legacy removal (Day 3)
- Phase 7.6: Performance validation (Days 4-5)

**Risks:**

## Conclusion

Phase 7 is a mandatory architectural review before any further work on Jira integration. It must be rigorous, externally validated, and human-approved before implementation begins.

**Success depends on:**
1. Thorough analysis of current state
2. Research of industry best practices
3. Principled design decisions documented in ADRs
4. Clear specifications and prototypes
5. Human approval of architecture

**Phase 7 will restore confidence through rigor, not rushed fixes.**
