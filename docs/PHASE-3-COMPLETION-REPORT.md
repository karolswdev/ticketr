## Technical Achievements

### 1. Cross-Platform Path Resolution

**Linux/Unix** (XDG Compliant):
```
Config: ~/.config/ticketr/           (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ticketr)
Data:   ~/.local/share/ticketr/      (or $XDG_DATA_HOME/ticketr)
Cache:  ~/.cache/ticketr/            (or $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ticketr)
```

**macOS** (Application Support):
```
Config: ~/Library/Application Support/ticketr/
Data:   ~/Library/Application Support/ticketr/
Cache:  ~/Library/Caches/ticketr/
```

**Windows** (Standard Conventions):
```
Config: %APPDATA%\ticketr\
Data:   %LOCALAPPDATA%\ticketr\
Cache:  %TEMP%\ticketr\
```

### 2. Environment Variable Support

Users can override default paths:
```bash
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/custom/config
export XDG_DATA_HOME=/custom/data
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=/custom/cache
```

### 3. Security Features

- **Directory Permissions**: 0755 (user read/write/execute, group/others read/execute)
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: PathResolver doesn't handle sensitive data
- **Safe Path Construction**: Uses `filepath.Join` to prevent path traversal
- **Clean Error Messages**: No path information leaked in errors

### 4. Testing Excellence

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Agent-Based Development**: Specialized agents (Builder, Verifier, Scribe) delivered focused, high-quality work
2. **Test-Driven Approach**: Writing tests first helped catch edge cases early
3. **Documentation**: Writing documentation in parallel with code ensured accuracy
4. **Integration Tests**: Real filesystem testing caught platform-specific issues
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple review cycles improved code quality

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Integration Execution**: Agent implementations need manual application to codebase
2. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Need actual Windows/macOS testing (currently only Linux)
3. **Migration Strategy**: Could have implemented migration tool in Phase 3

### Recommendations for Future Phases

1. **Early Integration**: Integrate new services immediately to validate design
2. **Platform CI/CD**: Set up CI pipeline for multi-platform testing
3. **User Testing**: Get early feedback on directory structure changes
4. **Documentation First**: Continue practice of documenting before implementing
