## Directory Cleanup Summary

### 1. `.agents/` Directory Cleanup

**Objective:** Remove transitive handover documents, preserve essential agent definitions

**Actions Taken:**
```bash
# Created archive directory
mkdir -p .agents/archive/

# Archived 9 transitive documents
.agents/handover-day12.5-scribe.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/handover-day12.5-tuiux.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/handover-day8-9-builder.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/verification-report-phase6-day12.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/verifier-handoff-visual-effects.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/verifier-report-visual-effects.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/visual-effects-integration-summary.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/handover-milestone-12.md → .agents/archive/
.agents/milestone-orchestrator-prompt.md → .agents/archive/

# Created README.md in archive for context
.agents/archive/README.md (new) - Explains archival rationale
```

**Files Retained (Essential):**
- `builder.agent.md` - Builder agent definition
- `verifier.agent.md` - Verifier agent definition
- `scribe.agent.md` - Scribe agent definition
- `steward.agent.md` - Steward agent definition
- `director.agent.md` - Director agent definition
- `tuiux.agent.md` - TUIUX agent definition

**Result:** Clean `.agents/` directory with only operational agent definitions. Historical context preserved in `archive/`.

---

### 2. Root Directory Cleanup

**Objective:** Remove completion reports and phase documents, retain only user-facing files

**Actions Taken:**
```bash
# Moved 10 completion reports to docs/history/
BUG-FIXES-APPLIED.md → docs/history/
CRITICAL-BUGS-REPORT.md → docs/history/
MILESTONE18-COMPLETE.md → docs/history/
PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md → docs/history/
PHASE4-WEEK16-COMPLETE.md → docs/history/
SCRIBE-MILESTONE18-DOCUMENTATION-REPORT.md → docs/history/
SCRIBE-SLICE4-DOCUMENTATION-REPORT.md → docs/history/
VERIFICATION-COMPLETE.md → docs/history/
WEEK14-TESTING-RESULTS.md → docs/history/
WEEK16-TESTING-GUIDE.md → docs/history/
```

**Files Retained (User-Facing):**
- `README.md` - Primary user documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Complete requirements specification
- `ROADMAP.md` - Symlink to `docs/development/ROADMAP.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines

## File Count Summary

### Before Cleanup:
```
Root directory: 17 markdown files (user-facing mixed with completion reports)
.agents/: 16 files (agent definitions mixed with handover docs)
docs/ top-level: 54 files (user guides mixed with planning/history)
docs/ subdirectories: 4 (archive, development, FEATURES, legacy)
```

### After Cleanup:
```
Root directory: 7 markdown files (100% user-facing)
.agents/: 6 files + 1 archive directory (clean agent definitions)
docs/ top-level: 27 files (user/developer guides only)
docs/ subdirectories: 7 (archive, development, FEATURES, legacy, history, planning, orchestration)
```

### Net Result:
- **42 files reorganized** (moved to appropriate subdirectories)
- **3 new subdirectories created** (history, planning, orchestration)
- **2 README files added** (archive explanations)
- **1 major document created** (RELEASE-NOTES-v3.1.1.md)
- **1 major document enhanced** (CHANGELOG.md v3.1.1 section)

---

## Cleanup Rationale

### Philosophy

**Goal:** Professional repository organization matching industry standards (kubectl, terraform, gh CLI)

**Principles:**
1. **Root directory = User-facing only** (README, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT, REQUIREMENTS, ROADMAP)
2. **docs/ top-level = Active documentation** (guides, troubleshooting, architecture)
3. **docs/subdirs = Context-specific** (history, planning, orchestration, development)
4. **Archive = Preserve, don't destroy** (historical context retained)

### Decisions Made

**1. Archive vs. Delete:**
- **Archived:** All handover documents, verification reports, completion reports
- **Deleted:** NONE (conservative approach, preserve all context)
- **Rationale:** Historical value for process analysis, audit trails, lessons learned

**2. Subdirectory Creation:**
- **history/:** Phase completion reports, assessments, verification results
- **planning/:** Technical specs, roadmaps, vision docs, wireframes
- **orchestration/:** Director guides, agent framework, workflow diagrams
- **Rationale:** Logical grouping reduces docs/ top-level clutter

**3. Root Directory Standard:**
- **7 markdown files only:** README, CHANGELOG, REQUIREMENTS, ROADMAP (symlink), CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, SUPPORT
- **Rationale:** Matches kubectl/terraform/gh CLI structure, professional first impression

**4. Documentation Organization:**
- **Top-level docs/ = Current, active guides**
- **Subdirectories = Context-specific or historical**
- **Rationale:** Easy discovery for users, context preservation for developers

---

## Remaining Work (Out of Scope for Day 13)

### Not Completed (Deferred):

**1. Spell Check:**
- **Tool needed:** `aspell` or equivalent
- **Scope:** All markdown files
- **Recommendation:** Run before Day 15 release

**2. Link Validation:**
- **Tool needed:** `markdown-link-check` or manual validation
- **Scope:** All internal and external links
- **Recommendation:** Run before Day 15 release

**3. Screenshot Updates:**
- **File:** `docs/screenshots-needed.md` lists required screenshots
- **Scope:** TUI with action bar, command palette, progress indicators, visual effects
- **Recommendation:** Optional for v3.1.1, can add in patch release

**4. Marketing GIF Recording:**
- **File:** `docs/MARKETING_GIF_SPECIFICATION.md` has complete recording guide
- **Scope:** 15-20 second GIF showcasing visual effects
- **Recommendation:** Optional for v3.1.1, can add post-release
