# Historical Phase Playbooks

## Overview

This directory contains historical phase playbooks from the development of ticketr. These documents guided execution during milestones 0-11 and are preserved for historical reference only.

## Contents

### Phase Playbooks

- **PHASE-1.md** - Initial Foundation (Milestones 0-3)
  - Core parsing and JIRA integration
  - Basic push functionality
  - State management groundwork

- **PHASE-2.md** - Enhanced Functionality (Milestones 4-7)
  - Deterministic hashing (Milestone 4)
  - Enhanced logging (Milestone 6)
  - Field inheritance (Milestone 7)

- **PHASE-3.md** - Advanced Features (Milestones 8-9)
  - Pull with subtasks (Milestone 8)
  - State-aware push (Milestone 9)

- **phase-hardening.md** - Quality & Stability (Milestones 10-11)
  - Documentation consolidation (Milestone 10)
  - Quality gates and automation (Milestone 11)

- **PHASE-n.md** - Template for future phases

## Status

**All phases completed:** Milestones 0-11 are complete as of October 16, 2025.

These playbooks were instrumental in:
- Organizing development work into logical phases
- Tracking dependencies between milestones
- Coordinating agent handoffs
- Maintaining development momentum
- Ensuring comprehensive testing and documentation

## Current Operational Documents

For current development, refer to these active documents:

- [ROADMAP.md](/ROADMAP.md) - Current milestone tracking and project roadmap
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](/ARCHITECTURE.md) - System architecture and design overview
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Contribution guidelines and development workflow
- [docs/WORKFLOW.md](/docs/WORKFLOW.md) - User workflow guide
- [docs/ci.md](/docs/ci.md) - CI/CD pipeline documentation

## Purpose of Preservation

These historical playbooks are kept for:

1. **Historical Context** - Understanding the evolution of the project architecture and design decisions
2. **Onboarding Reference** - Helping new contributors understand how the system was built incrementally
3. **Traceability** - Linking current code to the planning documents that guided its creation
4. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying successful development patterns for future phases
5. **Documentation Archaeology** - Recovering rationale for design choices when not documented elsewhere

## Usage Notes

**DO NOT** use these playbooks for current development:
- They describe work already completed
- Current requirements are in REQUIREMENTS-v2.md
- Current roadmap is in ROADMAP.md
- Current architecture is in ARCHITECTURE.md

**DO** refer to these playbooks when:
- Investigating why a particular design decision was made
- Understanding the sequence of feature development
- Onboarding as a new contributor
- Writing retrospectives or case studies

## Milestone Mapping

| Phase | Milestones | Key Achievements |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Phase 1 | 0-3 | Parser, JIRA adapter, basic push, state foundation |
| Phase 2 | 4-7 | Deterministic hashing, logging, field inheritance |
| Phase 3 | 8-9 | Pull with subtasks, state-aware push |
| Hardening | 10-11 | Documentation, quality gates, CI/CD automation |
| **Consolidation** | **12** | **Requirements governance, doc cleanup (current)** |
