## Test Scenarios Executed

### Test 1: Complete Field Inheritance

**Test Ticket:** SWARC-264 - "Field Inheritance Integration Test v4"

**Parent Ticket Fields:**
- Labels: `milestone-7, test, parent-field`

- **Markdown Custom Fields:** None (empty)
- **Expected Behavior:** Inherit all parent labels
- **API Verification Result:** ✅ PASS
  ```json
  {
    "labels": ["milestone-7", "test", "parent-field"]
  }
  ```
- **Inheritance Status:** ✅ Complete inheritance working

### Test 2: Partial Field Override

**Subtask 2:** SWARC-266 - "Override Labels Test"
- **Markdown Custom Fields:** `Labels: task-override, custom-label`
- **Expected Behavior:** Override parent labels with task-specific values
- **API Verification Result:** ✅ PASS
  ```json
  {
    "labels": ["task-override", "custom-label"]
  }
  ```
- **Override Status:** ✅ Override semantics working

### Test 3: Updated Subtask Inheritance

**Test Ticket:** SWARC-267 - "Field Inheritance Debug Test v5"

**Parent Ticket Fields:**
- Labels: `test-v5, debug-mode`

**Subtask 1:** SWARC-268 - "Debug Task 1"
- **API Verification Result:** ✅ PASS
  ```json
  {
    "labels": ["debug-mode", "test-v5"]
  }
  ```

**Subtask 2:** SWARC-269 - "Debug Task 2"
- **Markdown Override:** `Labels: override-test`
- **API Verification Result:** ✅ PASS
  ```json
  {
    "labels": ["override-test"]
  }
  ```

## Technical Validation

### Code Flow Verification

1. **Parser:** ✅ Correctly reads parent and task custom fields from Markdown
   ```
   Parent: Labels = "milestone-7, test, parent-field"
   Task 1: CustomFields = {} (empty)
   Task 2: CustomFields = {Labels: "task-override, custom-label"}
   ```

2. **Service Layer:** ✅ calculateFinalFields() merges correctly
   ```go
   Task 1 Final Fields: {Labels: "milestone-7, test, parent-field"}  // Inherited
   Task 2 Final Fields: {Labels: "task-override, custom-label"}      // Overridden
   ```

3. **Jira Adapter:** ✅ buildFieldsPayload() maps fields correctly
   ```
   Labels field mapped to JIRA 'labels' field (array type)
   Values converted: "milestone-7, test" → ["milestone-7", "test"]
   ```

4. **JIRA API:** ✅ Data stored correctly in JIRA database
   - Verified via direct API queries to `/rest/api/2/issue/{issueKey}`
   - All subtasks contain correct label values

### Debug Logging Output

During testing, debug logging confirmed:

```
DEBUG buildFieldsPayload: processing field 'Labels' = 'test-v5, debug-mode'
DEBUG buildFieldsPayload: found mapping for 'Labels': labels
DEBUG buildFieldsPayload: mapping 'Labels' -> 'labels' (type=array, value=[test-v5 debug-mode])
```

All fields were correctly:
- Recognized by the field mapping system
- Converted to appropriate JIRA data types
- Included in the API payload

## Important Finding: JIRA UI Configuration

### Issue Observed

Labels did NOT appear in the JIRA web UI when viewing subtasks, even though:
- The API confirmed labels were stored
- Field inheritance was working correctly
- Data was present in the JIRA database

### Root Cause

**JIRA Screen Configuration**: The "Sub-task" issue type in the SWARC project does not have the "Labels" field configured on its view/edit screens.

### Evidence

Direct API query to SWARC-268 returned:
```json
{
  "fields": {
    "summary": "Debug Task 1",
    "labels": ["debug-mode", "test-v5"]  ← Field exists with correct data
  }
}
```

But the JIRA UI for subtasks did not display the Labels field.

### Resolution

This is **NOT a bug in Ticketr**. This is a JIRA project configuration setting.

**To make labels visible on subtasks:**
1. JIRA Administration → Issues → Screens
2. Locate the screen scheme for "Sub-task" issue type
3. Add "Labels" field to the Sub-task Create/Edit/View screens

**Workaround for testing:**
Use the JIRA API or JQL to verify field values:
```bash
curl -u email:token https://instance.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/SWARC-268 | jq '.fields.labels'
```

## Requirements Compliance

### PROD-009: Hierarchical Field Inheritance

**Requirement:** The system MUST implement field inheritance where child tasks inherit custom fields from their parent ticket, with task-specific fields overriding inherited values.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT**

**Evidence:**
- Test 1 demonstrates complete inheritance
- Test 2 demonstrates override semantics
- Test 3 demonstrates update operations preserve inheritance

### PROD-202: Hierarchical Field Inheritance Logic

**Requirement:** The system MUST calculate final fields for tasks by merging task-specific fields over parent ticket fields.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLIANT**

**Evidence:**
- calculateFinalFields() correctly implements merge logic
- Unit tests TC-701.1 through TC-701.4 pass
- Integration tests confirm end-to-end behavior

## Lessons Learned

### 1. JIRA Configuration Matters

Field availability via API ≠ field visibility in UI. Always verify both:
- API data storage (what Ticketr controls)
- UI screen configuration (what JIRA admin controls)

### 2. API Verification is Essential

When UI doesn't show expected results, verify via direct API queries before assuming code bugs.

### 3. Debug Logging Strategy

Temporary debug logging at key points (service layer, adapter layer, field mapping) was instrumental in confirming correct behavior.

### 4. Real-World Testing Value

Integration testing with a real JIRA instance revealed configuration details that mock testing cannot uncover.

## Recommendations

### For Users

1. **Check JIRA Screen Configuration:** Ensure custom fields you want to inherit are configured on subtask screens in your JIRA project
2. **Use API for Verification:** When in doubt, query the JIRA API directly to verify field values
3. **Test Field Mapping:** Use the `ticketr schema` command to check available fields and mappings

### For Future Development

1. **Field Validation:** Consider adding a pre-flight check that warns if a custom field mapping exists but the field isn't available on the target issue type screen
2. **Logging Enhancement:** Add optional verbose mode that shows field mapping decisions without requiring code changes
3. **Documentation:** Add a troubleshooting section about JIRA screen configuration for custom fields

---

## Conclusion

Milestone 7 (Field Inheritance Compliance) has been successfully implemented and validated through integration testing with a production JIRA instance. All requirements (PROD-009, PROD-202) are met, and the feature works as designed.

The observed issue with labels not appearing in the JIRA UI for subtasks is a JIRA project configuration detail, not a code defect. The data is correctly stored and retrievable via the API.

**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**
