**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** APPROVED
**Decision Makers:** External AI Architects (Gemini, Codex), Engineering Team
**Consulted:** Gemini AI (Architectural Blessing), Codex AI (Pragmatic Assessment)

## Context

### Current Situation

Ticketr v3.1.1 currently uses a custom HTTP client implementation for Jira REST API integration (`internal/adapters/jira/jira_adapter.go`):

- **Lines of Code:** 1,136 lines of custom HTTP client logic
- **Maintenance Burden:** HIGH - Manual handling of:
  - HTTP request construction and error handling
  - JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for all Jira API responses
  - Custom pagination logic
  - Response parsing and type conversions
  - Rate limiting and retry logic
  - Authentication header management
- **Dependencies:** 0 external Jira libraries (Go stdlib only)
- **Testing Complexity:** Requires extensive mocking of Jira API responses

### Problem Statement

The custom HTTP client approach creates significant technical debt:

1. **High Maintenance Cost:** Every Jira API change requires manual updates to HTTP client code
2. **Boilerplate Code:** ~400 lines of HTTP plumbing that don't add business value
3. **Error-Prone:** Manual JSON parsing increases risk of field mapping bugs
4. **Limited Community Support:** Custom implementation lacks battle-testing from broader ecosystem
5. **Slower Feature Development:** New Jira features require implementing full HTTP flow

### Business Impact

- **Single User Context:** Ticketr has exactly 1 user, eliminating migration concerns
- **Production Stability:** Custom client is production-stable but creates future risk
- **Developer Velocity:** Custom client slows addition of new Jira features
- **Technical Debt:** Maintenance burden grows with each Jira API evolution

### Architectural Context

Ticketr follows **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**:

```
Core Business Logic (Domain)
        ↓
    Ports (Interfaces)
        ↓
    Adapters (Implementations)
        ↓
External Systems (Jira API)
```

The Jira adapter is isolated to the adapter layer, implementing the `JiraPort` interface. This architectural pattern enables swapping infrastructure components (like the Jira client library) **without touching core business logic**.

---

## Decision

**We will adopt `github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira` v1.17.0 as the underlying HTTP client for the Jira adapter implementation.**

The library will be isolated to the adapter layer (`internal/adapters/jira/jira_adapter_v2.go`), implementing the same `JiraPort` interface as the existing custom client.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Feature Flag System:** Environment variable `TICKETR_JIRA_ADAPTER_VERSION` controls which implementation is used
   - `v1`: Custom HTTP client (current implementation, preserved)
   - `v2`: Library-based implementation (new, default)
   - Invalid value: Returns error with helpful message

2. **Deprecation Timeline:**
   - **v3.1.1 (current):** Ship V2 as default, V1 available via feature flag
   - **v3.2.0 or v3.3.0:** Remove V1 code, remove feature flag, V2 becomes only implementation

3. **Rollback Strategy:**
   ```bash
   export TICKETR_JIRA_ADAPTER_VERSION=v1
   ticketr pull  # Instant rollback to custom HTTP client
   ```

---

## Rationale

### Technical Evaluation

| Criterion | Custom HTTP Client (V1) | go-jira Library (V2) | Decision Driver |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Lines of Code** | 1,136 | 757 | ✅ 33% reduction (-379 lines) |
| **Maintenance Burden** | HIGH (manual updates) | LOW (community maintained) | ✅ Reduced long-term cost |
| **Dependencies** | 0 external | +12 total | ⚠️ Acceptable tradeoff |
| **Security** | 0 CVEs (no deps) | 0 CVEs (vetted) | ✅ Equally secure |
| **Maturity** | 2 years (Ticketr-specific) | 9 years (2015-2025) | ✅ Battle-tested |
| **Adoption** | 1 user | 868 importers, 1,600 stars | ✅ Proven at scale |
| **Architecture Fit** | Clean (adapter layer) | Clean (adapter layer) | ✅ No coupling introduced |

### External Validation

#### Gemini AI Assessment: "Architectural Blessing"

**Quote:**
> "This is an **architecturally sound and highly recommended decision.** Your team's adoption of Hexagonal Architecture is paying dividends precisely as intended: you can swap a significant, complex infrastructure component (the Jira client) with minimal-to-no impact on your core business logic."

**Key Recommendations:**
1. ✅ Library is correctly isolated to adapter layer (no domain contamination)
2. ✅ Credential handling is "model implementation" - secure and correct
3. ✅ Feature flag approach is prudent for safety
4. ❌ Do NOT fork library proactively (creates unnecessary maintenance burden)
5. ✅ Integration tests validate V1/V2 behavioral parity
6. ✅ Keep V1 for 1-2 releases, then **must remove dead code**

#### Codex AI Assessment: "Pragmatic, Battle-Tested Choice"

**Quote:**
> "go-jira remains a pragmatic, battle-tested client for Jira Cloud in 2025 if you value stability over cutting-edge coverage and are prepared to patch edge cases locally."

**Key Recommendations:**
1. ✅ Mature library, widely used, workable for Jira Cloud REST v2
2. ⚠️ Expect to fork/vendor for quick fixes if needed (sporadic maintenance)
3. ✅ Light wrappers/patches locally for edge cases acceptable
4. ✅ Given maintenance constraint (single developer), library minimizes burden
5. ✅ Hybrid pattern: library for transport, domain layer for business logic

**Consensus:** Both AI architects unanimously approved the library integration as the correct architectural decision with manageable risks.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Keep Custom HTTP Client

**Pros:**
- Zero external dependencies
- Full control over HTTP layer
- No library maintenance risk

**Cons:**
- 1,136 lines of boilerplate to maintain
- Manual updates for every Jira API change
- Slower feature development
- Higher risk of HTTP-level bugs

**Decision:** Rejected - Technical debt outweighs dependency concerns

#### Alternative 2: ctreminiom/go-atlassian

**Pros:**
- Broader Atlassian coverage (Confluence, JSM, Jira)
- Modern API (launched 2021)
- Active development

**Cons:**
- Overkill for Ticketr (only need Jira Cloud)
- Younger library, less hardened
- Larger dependency footprint
- More complex API surface

**Decision:** Rejected - andygrunwald/go-jira is better fit for our narrow use case

#### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach (Library + Custom HTTP)

**Pros:**
- Can use library for common operations, custom for edge cases

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent architecture (two HTTP strategies)
- Difficult to debug (which layer failed?)
- Still maintains boilerplate code
- Confusing for future maintainers

**Decision:** Rejected - Feature flag provides better safety without inconsistency

   - **Impact:** V2 performance characteristics untested
   - **Mitigation:** Benchmark tests created (acceptance: V2 within 20% of V1)
   - **Risk Level:** Low - Library is battle-tested at scale

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Library abandonment | Medium | Medium | Hexagonal architecture allows adapter swap; fork plan documented | Engineering |
| Behavioral divergence V1→V2 | Medium | High | Integration tests validate parity; feature flag rollback | QA |
| Performance regression | Low | Medium | Benchmarks validate acceptable performance | Engineering |
| Integration issues | Low | High | CI tests both adapters; manual UAT before V1 removal | QA |

## Monitoring & Success Criteria

### Deployment Monitoring

**Metrics to Track:**

1. **Error Rate Comparison:**
   ```bash
   # V1 errors
   grep "\[jira-v1\]" logs/ | wc -l

   # V2 errors
   grep "\[jira-v2\]" logs/ | wc -l
   ```

2. **Performance Metrics:**
   - API call latency (V1 vs V2)
   - Memory usage (V2 should be comparable)
   - Request success rate (V2 should be ≥99.9% like V1)

3. **Functional Validation:**
   - Ticket creation success rate
   - Subtask fetching reliability
   - Custom field mapping accuracy

### Success Criteria

**Must Achieve Before V1 Removal:**

- [ ] V2 error rate ≤ V1 error rate (over 2 weeks)
- [ ] V2 performance within 20% of V1 (benchmark results)
- [ ] 100% V1/V2 behavioral parity (integration tests pass)
- [ ] 0 critical bugs reported in V2 (2 week window)
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed successfully

**Quality Gates:**

- [ ] All tests pass (147 existing + new integration tests)
- [ ] `go build ./cmd/ticketr` succeeds
- [ ] `go vet ./...` reports no warnings
- [ ] Coverage maintained ≥74.8%

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered with V2:

### Option 1: Instant Environment Variable Rollback (Recommended)

```bash
export TICKETR_JIRA_ADAPTER_VERSION=v1
ticketr pull  # Uses V1 automatically, no restart required
```

**Rollback Time:** < 1 minute
**Scope:** Per-user or system-wide
**Risk:** None - V1 code is preserved and tested

### Option 2: Default Change

Update factory default in `internal/adapters/jira/factory.go`:

```go
if version == "" {
    version = "v1" // Change default back to V1
}
```

**Rollback Time:** ~5 minutes (rebuild + deploy)
**Scope:** All users
**Risk:** Low - requires code change

### Rollback Decision Criteria

**Trigger Rollback If:**

1. V2 error rate >2x V1 error rate (sustained over 24 hours)
2. Critical bug affecting >50% of operations
3. Data loss or corruption detected
4. Performance degradation >50% slower than V1

## Appendix B: Feature Flag Design

### Factory Pattern

**File:** `internal/adapters/jira/factory.go`

```go
func NewJiraAdapterFromConfigWithVersion(
    config *domain.WorkspaceConfig,
    fieldMappings map[string]interface{},
) (ports.JiraPort, error) {
    version := os.Getenv("TICKETR_JIRA_ADAPTER_VERSION")
    if version == "" {
        version = "v2" // Default to V2 (library-based)
    }

    switch version {
    case "v1":
        return NewJiraAdapterFromConfig(config, fieldMappings)
    case "v2":
        return NewJiraAdapterV2FromConfig(config, fieldMappings)
    default:
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("unknown adapter version: %s (valid: v1, v2)", version)
    }
}
```

### Version Logging

**Purpose:** Distinguish V1 vs V2 errors in production logs

**V1 Errors:**
```go
return fmt.Errorf("[jira-v1] failed to search tickets: %w", err)
```

**V2 Errors:**
```go
return fmt.Errorf("[jira-v2] failed to search tickets: %w", err)
```

**Log Query:**
```bash
# Compare error rates
grep "\[jira-v1\]" logs/*.log | wc -l
grep "\[jira-v2\]" logs/*.log | wc -l
```

## Appendix C: Credential Flow Architecture

### Security Model

**Gemini's Assessment:**
> "The adapter is 'dumb.' It doesn't know WHERE the credentials came from (keyring, env var, file). It is simply configured with them. This upholds the principle of dependency inversion and keeps your security-sensitive logic centralized in the WorkspaceService."

### V2 Credential Handling

```go
func NewJiraAdapterV2FromConfig(config *domain.WorkspaceConfig, ...) (ports.JiraPort, error) {
    // V2 receives credentials as simple struct values
    tp := jira.BasicAuthTransport{
        Username: config.Username,  // From OS keyring (via WorkspaceService)
        Password: config.APIToken,  // From OS keyring (via WorkspaceService)
    }

    client, err := jira.NewClient(tp.Client(), config.JiraURL)
    // Adapter doesn't know credentials came from keyring
}
```

### Security Guarantees

- ✅ No credentials in database (only workspace ID reference)
- ✅ No credentials in logs (automatic redaction)
- ✅ OS-level encryption (macOS Keychain / Linux Secret Service / Windows Credential Manager)
- ✅ Per-user isolation
- ✅ Adapter layer doesn't handle credential storage

**Verdict (Gemini):** "This is a model implementation."
