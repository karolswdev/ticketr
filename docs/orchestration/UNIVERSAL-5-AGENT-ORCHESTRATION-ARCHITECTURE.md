# UNIVERSAL 5-AGENT ORCHESTRATION ARCHITECTURE
## A Proven Methodology for Multi-Agent Software Development

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Production-Ready Architecture
**Validation:** Proven on Ticketr v3.0 (15,000+ LOC, 74.8% test coverage, zero regressions)

---

## PART 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is this architecture?

The Universal 5-Agent Orchestration Architecture is a **battle-tested methodology** for software development using specialized AI agents working in coordinated sequence. It transforms software delivery from ad-hoc implementation into a systematic, quality-driven process with built-in validation gates.

**Core Concept**: Five specialized agents (Builder, Verifier, Scribe, Steward) orchestrated by a Director agent deliver production-ready software through sequential delegation with mandatory quality gates.

### Why does it work?

**Specialization Through Separation of Concerns:**
- Each agent has a single, clear responsibility
- Agents excel at their specialized tasks
- No agent can skip another agent's validation
- Quality is enforced through architectural constraints

**Sequential Validation:**
```
Implementation → Testing → Documentation → Approval → Deployment
```

Each stage validates the previous, creating multiple layers of quality assurance that catch issues early and prevent technical debt accumulation.

**Documentation as Primary Artifact:**
- Documentation is created alongside code, not after
- All design decisions are recorded
- Future maintainers have complete context
- Knowledge transfer is built into the process

### Proven Results

**Ticketr v3.0 Case Study** (January-October 2025):
- **15,000+ lines of code** delivered across 4 major phases
- **74.8% test coverage** overall, 95%+ on critical paths
- **450+ passing tests** with zero regressions introduced
- **Zero P0 bugs** in production deployment
- **Complete documentation** maintained throughout (1,670+ lines)
- **Predictable velocity**: 2,000-5,000 LOC per phase delivered on schedule

**Quality Metrics:**
- Test suite passing rate: 100%
- Code review approval rate: 95% (first pass)
- Documentation completeness: 100%
- Post-release critical bugs: 0

### When to use this approach

**Ideal For:**
- ✅ Medium to large projects (5,000+ LOC)
- ✅ Teams needing consistent quality standards
- ✅ Projects requiring comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Codebases with long-term maintenance needs
- ✅ Distributed teams with async workflows
- ✅ Projects requiring audit trails and traceability
- ✅ Architectures with testability requirements
- ✅ Greenfield projects or major rewrites

**Not Ideal For:**
- ❌ Throwaway prototypes or POCs
- ❌ Projects under 1,000 LOC
- ❌ Urgent hotfixes (use expedited process variant)
- ❌ Simple documentation-only updates

## PART 2: DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

#### 1. Quality Through Sequential Validation

**Principle**: Each phase validates the previous phase's output.

**Implementation**:
```
Builder creates code + tests
    ↓
Verifier validates implementation quality
    ↓
Scribe documents for users
    ↓
Steward approves architecture
    ↓
Director commits to repository
```

**Rationale**: Multiple specialized reviews catch different classes of errors. Builder focuses on correctness, Verifier on coverage and regressions, Scribe on clarity, Steward on long-term architecture.

**Result**: Issues caught early when cheapest to fix. Zero regressions in production.

#### 2. Separation of Concerns (Agent Specialization)

**Principle**: Each agent has exactly one responsibility and the authority to execute it.

**Agent Boundaries**:
| Agent | Responsibility | Authority | Cannot Do |
|-------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Director | Orchestration, planning, commit creation | Delegate work, approve deliverables, escalate blockers | Write code, tests, or docs |
| Builder | Implementation, initial testing | Write code, create tests, make implementation decisions | Skip testing, bypass architecture |
| Verifier | Quality assurance, test coverage | Extend tests, validate requirements, approve/reject | Change implementation directly |
| Scribe | Documentation creation | Write user/technical docs, update examples | Change code behavior |
| Steward | Architectural oversight | Approve/reject major changes, security review | Implement features directly |

**Rationale**: Clear boundaries prevent scope creep and ensure each aspect receives appropriate expertise.

**Result**: 95% first-pass approval rate (agents stay in their lane, do it well).

#### 3. Documentation as Primary Artifact

**Principle**: Documentation is created during development, not after, and has equal importance to code.

**Documentation Types**:
- **User-Facing**: README, user guides, examples, troubleshooting
- **Technical**: Architecture documents, API docs, design decisions
- **Process**: Roadmaps, completion reports, handoff notes
- **Audit**: Change logs, requirements traceability matrices

**Enforcement**: Scribe agent is mandatory for all user-facing changes. No code reaches production without documentation.

**Rationale**: Future maintainers need context. 6 months later, nobody remembers why decisions were made. Documentation prevents knowledge loss.

**Result**: Complete documentation maintained across 15,000+ LOC project. Zero "why was this built this way?" mysteries.

#### 4. Traceability and Accountability

**Principle**: Every artifact links to requirements. Every decision is recorded.

**Traceability Chain**:
```
User Requirement (PROD-123)
    ↓
Roadmap Milestone (Phase 2, Milestone 5)
    ↓
Agent Delegation (Builder Task: Implement workspace switching)
    ↓
Implementation (workspace_service.go, +200 lines)
    ↓
Tests (workspace_service_test.go, 25 tests)
    ↓
Documentation (workspace-guide.md, updated)
    ↓
Git Commit (feat(workspace): Add switching capability, refs PROD-123)
```

**Artifacts Created**:
- TodoLists track granular task completion
- Milestone completion reports document what was delivered
- Git commits reference requirements
- Documentation cross-references architecture

**Rationale**: Compliance, audits, and debugging all require "why was this built?" answers. Traceability provides them.

**Result**: Any feature can be traced from user need → requirement → implementation → tests → docs → commit in under 5 minutes.

#### 5. Fail Fast, Fix Early

**Principle**: Detect issues at the earliest possible stage with mandatory quality gates.

**Quality Gates**:
| Gate | Criteria | Enforcer | Failure Action |
|------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Build | Code compiles | Builder | Rework immediately |
| Test | All tests pass | Builder | Fix before Verifier |
| Coverage | >70% on new code | Verifier | Add tests or reject |
| Regression | Zero new failures | Verifier | Fix before proceeding |
| Requirements | All criteria met | Verifier | Implementation gaps identified |
| Documentation | Examples tested, accurate | Scribe | Rework before commit |
| Architecture | Design compliance | Steward | Refactor or justify |

**Enforcement**: No agent can skip the next agent. Director enforces sequence.

**Rationale**: Bugs caught in Builder phase cost minutes. Bugs caught in production cost days.

**Result**: Zero regressions in 450+ test suite across 6+ months of active development.

     └───────────┘  └─────────────┘ └────────────┘ └──────────┘
```

**Communication Flow**:
- **Vertical**: Director delegates to agents, agents report back
- **Horizontal**: No direct agent-to-agent communication (prevents chaos)
- **Sequential**: Director enforces order (Build → Verify → Document → Approve)

### Agent Specialization Rationale

**Why 5 agents instead of 1 general-purpose agent?**

1. **Cognitive Load**: Single agent handling code, tests, docs, and architecture makes mistakes
2. **Quality**: Specialist review catches issues generalist misses
3. **Consistency**: Each agent develops expertise in their domain
4. **Accountability**: Clear ownership when issues arise
5. **Parallelization**: Future: Independent tasks can run concurrent specialized agents

**Why these 5 roles specifically?**

- **Builder**: Software requires implementation (obvious)
- **Verifier**: Separate QA prevents "author blindness" to own bugs
- **Scribe**: Documentation requires different mindset than coding
- **Steward**: Long-term architecture needs oversight beyond tactical implementation
- **Director**: Orchestration requires holistic view no specialist has

### Collaboration Protocols

#### Sequential Handoffs

**Standard Flow**:
```
1. Director → Builder: "Implement feature X with acceptance criteria Y"
2. Builder → Director: "Implementation complete, tests passing, notes for Verifier"
3. Director → Verifier: "Validate implementation, check coverage, verify requirements"
4. Verifier → Director: "APPROVED - all quality standards met" OR "REQUEST FIXES"
5. Director → Scribe: "Document feature X with examples Y"
6. Scribe → Director: "Documentation complete, cross-refs validated"
7. Director → Steward: "Approve phase gate" (major changes only)
8. Steward → Director: "APPROVED" (or conditions/rejection)
9. Director: Creates git commits, updates roadmap
```

**Rework Loop** (when quality gate fails):
```
Verifier → Director: "REQUEST FIXES: Coverage 65% < 70% target"
Director → Builder: "Add tests for X, Y, Z to meet coverage"
Builder → Director: "Tests added, coverage now 82%"
Director → Verifier: "Re-validate implementation"
Verifier → Director: "APPROVED"
[Proceed to Scribe]
```

**Critical Rule**: No agent skipping allowed. If Verifier finds issues, loop back to Builder. Never proceed to Scribe with failing tests.

### 3.1 Agent Role: DIRECTOR

#### Responsibility

Orchestrate milestone execution through strategic planning and agent delegation.

**Primary Functions**:
- Break roadmap milestones into atomic, delegatable tasks
- Assign work to appropriate specialized agents
- Verify deliverables meet quality standards before proceeding
- Enforce test coverage and documentation requirements
- Create logical git commits with proper attribution
- Track progress using structured task lists
- Escalate blockers to human stakeholders

#### Decision-Making Authority

**Director CAN**:
- ✅ Delegate work to any agent with detailed requirements
- ✅ Approve or reject agent deliverables based on quality standards
- ✅ Request rework when standards not met (with specific feedback)
- ✅ Create git commits for completed, approved work
- ✅ Update project roadmap and tracking documents
- ✅ Escalate architectural uncertainty or blockers to humans
- ✅ Determine commit structure (single vs. multiple commits)

**Director CANNOT**:
- ❌ Write production code (must delegate to Builder)
- ❌ Write tests (must delegate to Verifier or include in Builder scope)
- ❌ Write documentation (must delegate to Scribe)
- ❌ Make solo architectural decisions (must consult Steward for major changes)
- ❌ Skip quality gates (Builder → Verifier → Scribe sequence mandatory)

#### Deliverables

**Per Milestone**:
1. **Execution Plan**: Work breakdown, agent assignments, timeline estimate
2. **Task List**: Granular todo items with status tracking
3. **Quality Reviews**: Approval/rejection decisions for each agent deliverable
4. **Git Commits**: Logical, well-documented commits with co-authorship
5. **Progress Reports**: Updates at key checkpoints (start, after each agent, completion)
6. **Milestone Completion Summary**: Deliverables, test evidence, commits created

**Per Phase** (collection of milestones):
1. **Phase Execution Roadmap**: How the phase will be executed milestone-by-milestone
2. **Phase Completion Report**: Aggregated metrics, lessons learned, handoff notes

## PART 4: INTERFACE CONTROL DOCUMENT (ICD) SPECIFICATION

### What is the ICD?

The **Interface Control Document (ICD)** is the centralized repository of all project artifacts, documentation, and tracking information. It defines the standard file structure, naming conventions, and cross-referencing standards that enable agents and humans to find information quickly and maintain consistency.

**Purpose**:
- Single source of truth for project state
- Enables agents to find requirements, architecture, and prior decisions
- Facilitates onboarding (new team members find everything in standard locations)
- Supports audits and compliance (all decisions documented and traceable)
- Prevents knowledge loss (context preserved over time)

**Scope**:
- All documentation (user-facing, technical, process)
- All tracking artifacts (roadmaps, backlogs, completion reports)
- All reference materials (templates, checklists, decision trees)
- Configuration for agents (system prompts, delegation guides)

### Required Project Artifacts

**Tier 1: Mandatory** (project cannot proceed without these)
- Project vision/charter (why does this exist?)
- Architecture document (how is it structured?)
- Roadmap (what will be built, when?)
- Quality standards (what defines "done"?)
- README (how do users/contributors get started?)

**Tier 2: Strongly Recommended** (quality suffers without these)
- Methodology handbook (how do we work?)
- Troubleshooting guide (common issues + solutions)
- Glossary (term definitions)
- Contribution guide (how to contribute)
- Changelog (what changed in each version?)

**Tier 3: As-Needed** (create when complexity warrants)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Integration guides
- Migration guides
- Performance tuning guides
- Security guidelines

### File Naming Conventions

**Principles**:
- Descriptive names (no abbreviations unless universally understood)
- UPPERCASE for top-level documents (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- kebab-case for docs (architecture-decision-record.md)
- Consistent prefixes for series (ADR-001, MILESTONE-18-COMPLETE)

**Patterns**:

| Document Type | Pattern | Example |
|---------------|---------|---------|
| Architecture Decision | ADR-NNN-[topic].md | ADR-001-database-choice.md |
| Milestone Completion | MILESTONE-N-COMPLETE.md | MILESTONE-18-COMPLETE.md |
| Phase Checklist | PHASE-N-CHECKLIST.md | PHASE-4-CHECKLIST.md |
| Phase Completion | PHASE-N-COMPLETION-REPORT.md | PHASE-3-COMPLETION-REPORT.md |
| User Guide | [topic]-guide.md | workspace-management-guide.md |
| Reference Doc | [TOPIC].md (uppercase) | TROUBLESHOOTING.md |

**Version Markers**:
- Include version in title comment: `<!-- Document Version: 2.0 -->`
- Include date: `<!-- Last Updated: 2025-10-19 -->`
- Include status: `<!-- Status: Production / Draft / Deprecated -->`

```

**Requirement Traceability**:
```markdown
<!-- In implementation doc -->
This feature implements [REQ-123](../execution/ROADMAP.md#req-123).

<!-- In code commit message -->
feat(auth): Implement OAuth2 login

Implements REQ-123 from Phase 2 Milestone 5.
See docs/execution/ROADMAP.md#req-123 for requirements.

## PART 5: ORCHESTRATION METHODOLOGY

### Pre-Execution Planning

**Purpose**: Understand requirements, assess complexity, create execution plan.

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

**Director Activities**:

1. **Read Key Documents** (5 min):
   ```
   - docs/execution/ROADMAP.md (next incomplete milestone)
   - docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md (relevant sections)
   - REQUIREMENTS.md (applicable requirements)
   ```

2. **Extract Information**:
   - Milestone number and title
   - Acceptance criteria (checklist items)
   - Dependencies on previous milestones
   - Estimated complexity (files affected, LOC estimate)

3. **Analyze Current Codebase** (5 min):
   - Find relevant existing files
   - Understand current patterns
   - Identify integration points
   - Assess impact (which components affected?)

4. **Create Work Breakdown** (5 min):
   - Break milestone into Builder-ready tasks
   - Identify Verifier validation requirements
   - List Scribe documentation needs
   - Determine if Steward review required

5. **Create Task List** (3 min):
   ```
   [
     {"content": "Analyze milestone requirements", "status": "in_progress"},
     {"content": "Delegate implementation to Builder", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Review Builder deliverable", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Delegate validation to Verifier", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Review Verifier results", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Delegate documentation to Scribe", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Review Scribe deliverable", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Create git commits", "status": "pending"},
     {"content": "Update roadmap and mark complete", "status": "pending"}
   ]
   ```

6. **Communicate Plan** (2 min):
   - Milestone scope summary
   - Work breakdown
   - Timeline estimate
   - Known risks or dependencies

**Output**: Execution plan, task list, initial progress report.

### Execution Loop Cycle

**Purpose**: Implement, validate, document, commit the milestone.

**Duration**: 2-8 hours (milestone-dependent)

**Standard Workflow**:

```

**Critical Rules**:
1. **Never Skip Verifier**: Even if tests pass locally, Verifier validates
2. **Never Skip Scribe**: Documentation is mandatory for user-facing changes
3. **Sequential Execution**: Complete current agent before next
4. **Quality Gates**: Do not proceed if standards unmet
5. **One Task In Progress**: Task list shows exactly one "in_progress" at a time

### Post-Execution Validation

**Purpose**: Confirm milestone completion, verify clean state, document success.

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

**Final Validation Checklist**:
```
[ ] All tests passing
[ ] Build successful
[ ] Working directory clean (git status)
[ ] Commits created with proper messages
[ ] Roadmap updated (checkboxes marked)
[ ] Task list cleared

### Continuous Improvement

**After Each Milestone**:
1. **Capture Learnings**: What went well? What was challenging?
2. **Update Framework**: Document new patterns or anti-patterns discovered
3. **Refine Estimates**: Adjust future task sizing based on actuals
4. **Communicate**: Share insights with human stakeholders

**Retrospective Questions**:
- Did agent deliverables meet quality standards on first submission?
- Were task estimates accurate?
- Did any agent require multiple rework cycles? Why?
- Were there communication gaps between agents?
- Did documentation keep pace with implementation?

**Framework Evolution**:
- Update methodology documents with proven patterns

## PART 7: ADAPTATION GUIDE

### How to Customize for Different Project Types

This framework is universal, but specific projects need adaptation. Here's how.

---

#### Adaptation 1: Web Application Project

**Technology Adjustments**:
- Builder prompt: Specify framework (Django, Rails, Express, etc.)
- Test framework: Frontend tests (Jest, Cypress) + Backend tests
- Documentation: API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

**Architecture Pattern**: MVC or Hexagonal with API layer

**Quality Standards**:
- Coverage targets: 70% backend, 60% frontend (UI tests harder)
- Performance: API response time <200ms, page load <2s
- Security: OWASP Top 10 compliance mandatory

**Milestone Structure**:
- Early milestones: Foundation (auth, database, API skeleton)
- Mid milestones: Features (CRUD operations, business logic)
- Late milestones: Polish (UI/UX, performance, deployment)

---

#### Adaptation 2: CLI Tool Project

**Technology Adjustments**:
- Builder prompt: Specify CLI framework (Cobra, Click, Commander, etc.)
- Testing: Command output validation, exit code checks
- Documentation: Man pages, help text, usage examples

**Architecture Pattern**: Hexagonal with thin CLI adapter

**Quality Standards**:
- Coverage targets: 80% (CLI tools easier to test)
- Performance: Startup <100ms, command execution <1s
- UX: Help text for all commands, clear error messages

**Milestone Structure**:
- Early: Core commands (init, config)
- Mid: Feature commands (create, list, update, delete)
- Late: Advanced features (batch operations, scripting support)

---

#### Adaptation 3: Library/SDK Project

**Technology Adjustments**:
- Builder prompt: Emphasize API design, backward compatibility
- Testing: Extensive unit tests, example programs
- Documentation: API docs, integration guides, migration guides

**Architecture Pattern**: Layered (public API → internal implementation)

**Quality Standards**:
- Coverage targets: 90%+ (libraries must be rock-solid)
- Performance: Benchmarks for all public methods
- Versioning: Semantic versioning strictly enforced

**Milestone Structure**:
- Early: Core API surface
- Mid: Advanced features
- Late: Performance optimization, polish

---

#### Adaptation 4: Data Pipeline Project

**Technology Adjustments**:
- Builder prompt: Specify data processing framework (Airflow, Spark, etc.)
- Testing: Data quality tests, integration tests with real data
- Documentation: Data schemas, pipeline diagrams, monitoring guides

**Architecture Pattern**: ETL/ELT with pluggable sources/sinks

**Quality Standards**:
- Coverage targets: 70% (data pipelines have more integration than unit tests)
- Performance: Throughput (records/sec), latency (end-to-end)
- Data quality: Schema validation, null checks, duplicate detection

**Milestone Structure**:
- Early: Infrastructure (connectors, orchestration)
- Mid: Transformations (business logic)
- Late: Monitoring, alerting, optimization

---

### Scaling Up/Down the Team

#### Scaling Up (Large Projects)

**Indicators**:
- Project >50,000 LOC
- Team >5 developers
- Multiple subsystems/components

**Adaptations**:
- **Multiple Builder Agents**: Assign Builders to subsystems (one for backend, one for frontend)
- **Specialized Verifiers**: QA team instead of single agent
- **Technical Writers**: Dedicated Scribe team for docs
- **Architecture Council**: Multiple Stewards for different domains

**Communication**: Add integration layer (Integration Director coordinates subsystem Directors)

---

#### Scaling Down (Small Projects)

**Indicators**:
- Project <5,000 LOC
- Solo developer or pair
- Simple architecture

**Adaptations**:
- **Combine Agents**: Builder + Verifier can be same agent (with checklist)
- **Simplified Scribe**: Director can handle simple doc updates
- **Skip Steward**: For simple projects, Director handles architecture

**Minimum Viable**:
- Builder: Required (someone must write code)
- Verifier: Required (quality cannot be skipped)
- Scribe: Required for any production project
- Steward: Optional for projects <10,000 LOC
- Director: Always required (someone must orchestrate)

---

### Technology Stack Considerations

#### Compiled Languages (Go, Rust, C++)

**Builder Focus**:
- Compilation errors caught early (fast feedback)
- Type safety reduces certain test needs
- Memory safety (Rust) reduces error paths

**Verifier Focus**:
- Benchmark tests important (performance-critical languages)
- Integration tests for cross-compilation
- Race detection tools

---

#### Interpreted Languages (Python, JavaScript, Ruby)

**Builder Focus**:
- Type hints/TypeScript recommended (catches errors early)
- Linting critical (no compiler to catch issues)

**Verifier Focus**:
- Higher test coverage needed (no compiler safety net)
- Dynamic analysis tools (mypy, ESLint)

---

#### Database-Heavy Projects

**Builder Focus**:
- Schema migrations as code
- ORM vs raw SQL decisions documented

**Verifier Focus**:
- Database integration tests
- Migration rollback tests
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes

**Scribe Focus**:
- Database schema documentation
- Migration guides for users

---

### Team Size Adjustments

#### Solo Developer

**Approach**: Director (human) delegates to AI agents

**Workflow**:
1. Human acts as Director
2. Delegates to Builder AI
3. Reviews Builder output
4. Delegates to Verifier AI
5. Reviews Verifier output
6. Delegates to Scribe AI
7. Reviews Scribe output
8. Creates commits as Director

**Benefits**: Solo developer gets specialized expertise without team

---

#### Pair/Small Team (2-4 developers)

**Approach**: Developers rotate Director role

**Workflow**:
- Dev A: Director for Milestone 1
- Dev B: Director for Milestone 2
- Dev A: Director for Milestone 3
- (Rotate)

**Benefits**: Knowledge sharing, no single point of failure

---

#### Large Team (5+ developers)

**Approach**: Dedicated Director role (lead/architect)

**Workflow**:
- Lead Developer: Permanent Director
- Team Members: Execute agent outputs (or supplement AI agents)
- Specialization: Some devs focus on specific components

**Benefits**: Consistent vision, clear responsibility

---

### Timeline Adjustments

#### Urgent Delivery (Weeks)

**Adaptations**:
- **Smaller Milestones**: 1-2 days each
- **Parallel Workstreams**: Multiple Directors + Builders on independent features
- **Reduced Steward Involvement**: Skip for non-critical changes
- **Abbreviated Documentation**: README + API docs only, defer guides

**Trade-offs**: Increased coordination overhead, potential technical debt

---

#### Standard Delivery (Months)

**No Adaptations Needed**: Framework designed for this timeline

---

#### Long-Term Projects (Years)

**Adaptations**:
- **Quarterly Architecture Reviews**: Regular Steward involvement
- **Living Documentation**: Continuous Scribe updates, not just on milestones
- **Refactoring Phases**: Dedicated milestones for paying down tech debt
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Explicit onboarding documentation for new team members

---

- **Trend**: Estimates should improve (get more accurate) over time

**Agent Rework Cycles**:
- **Target**: <1.5 average rework cycles per milestone
- **Measurement**: Count how many times Builder must redo work
- **Trend**: Should decrease as quality improves

**Documentation Lag**:
- **Target**: 0 days (documentation completes same milestone as code)
- **Measurement**: Time between code commit and docs commit
- **Trend**: Should be 0 throughout project (enforced by process)

---

#### Satisfaction Metrics

### Appendix B: Complete System Prompt Templates

#### Template: Director Agent (Generic)

```markdown
You are the DIRECTOR agent in a 5-agent software development team for [PROJECT_NAME].

## Project Context

**Project**: [PROJECT_NAME]
**Purpose**: [What this project does]
**Technology**: [Language, frameworks]
**Architecture**: [Pattern, e.g., Hexagonal]

## Primary Responsibility

Orchestrate milestone execution through strategic planning and delegation to specialized agents (Builder, Verifier, Scribe, Steward).

## Authority

**You CAN**:
- Delegate work to any agent with detailed requirements
- Approve or reject agent deliverables based on quality standards
- Request rework when quality criteria not met
- Create git commits for completed work
- Update project tracking documents (roadmap, task lists)
- Escalate blockers to human stakeholders

**You CANNOT**:
- Write production code (delegate to Builder)
- Write tests (delegate to Verifier or Builder)
- Write documentation (delegate to Scribe)
- Make major architectural decisions alone (consult Steward)
- Skip quality gates (Builder → Verifier → Scribe sequence mandatory)

## Workflow

For each milestone:

1. **Plan**:
   - Read roadmap: `docs/execution/ROADMAP.md`
   - Extract acceptance criteria
   - Create work breakdown (Builder/Verifier/Scribe tasks)
   - Create task list
   - Communicate plan

2. **Execute**:
   - Delegate to Builder: Implementation + tests
   - Review Builder deliverable: APPROVE or REJECT
   - Delegate to Verifier: Validation + coverage
   - Review Verifier deliverable: APPROVED or REQUEST FIXES
   - Delegate to Scribe: Documentation
   - Review Scribe deliverable: APPROVE or REVISE
   - [Optional] Delegate to Steward: Phase gate approval

3. **Complete**:
   - Create git commits (conventional format + co-authorship)
   - Update roadmap checkboxes
   - Clear task list
   - Create completion summary

## Deliverable Format

**Execution Plan** (start):
- Milestone goal (1-2 sentences)
- Work breakdown (agent assignments)
- Timeline estimate
- Known risks

**Progress Updates** (throughout):
- Task list with statuses
- Current phase
- Blockers (if any)

**Quality Reviews** (after each agent):
- Agent deliverable summary
- Quality check results
- Decision: APPROVED or REJECTED with feedback

**Completion Summary** (end):
- Deliverables achieved
- Test evidence
- Commits created
- Next steps

## Quality Standards

**Builder**:
- Code compiles
- Tests pass
- Architecture patterns followed

**Verifier**:
- Full suite passes
- Coverage ≥70% for new code
- Zero regressions
- Clear APPROVE/REQUEST FIXES

**Scribe**:
- User-facing changes documented
- Examples tested
- Cross-references validated
- Roadmap updated

## Communication

**Reports to**: Human stakeholders
**Receives from**: Builder, Verifier, Scribe, Steward
**Escalates when**: Blocked >30min, architecture uncertainty, agent fails 3+ times, security concerns

## Success Criteria

- Milestone delivered on time
- All acceptance criteria met
- Test coverage targets achieved
- Zero regressions
- Complete documentation
- Git commits with attribution
- Roadmap accurate
```

#### Template: Builder Agent (Python/Django)

```markdown
You are the BUILDER agent for [PROJECT_NAME].

## Technology Stack

- Language: Python 3.11+
- Framework: Django 4.2
- Database: PostgreSQL 15
- Testing: pytest, pytest-django
- Code Style: black, flake8, mypy

## Architecture Pattern

Django MVT with service layer:
- **Models**: Data models (Django ORM)
- **Views**: HTTP request handlers (thin, delegates to services)
- **Services**: Business logic (thick, testable)
- **Templates**: HTML rendering

**Rules**:
- No business logic in views (only request/response handling)
- All business logic in services
- Models are data structures only (no complex logic)

## Primary Responsibility

Implement code changes with initial test coverage, ensuring code compiles and tests pass.

## Authority

**You CAN**:
- Write production code
- Create or modify models, views, services
- Write tests
- Make tactical implementation decisions

**You CANNOT**:
- Skip tests
- Violate architecture (no business logic in views)
- Make strategic architectural decisions (ask Steward via Director)
- Deliver failing code

## Deliverable Format

### 1. Implementation Summary
2-3 sentences: what was built, how it integrates, key decisions.

### 2. Files Modified
| File | Lines Added | Lines Modified | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------|

### 3. Test Results
```bash
$ pytest tests/ -v --cov=src
[Full output]
```

### 4. Build Verification
```bash

- Pass: `black .` (formatting)
- Pass: `flake8 .` (linting)
- Pass: `mypy .` (type checking)
- Type hints on all public functions
- Docstrings (Google style) on all public functions

**Tests**:
- All tests pass: `pytest tests/`
- Coverage ≥80%: `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term`
- Happy paths covered
- Error paths covered

**Architecture**:
- No business logic in views
- Services contain all business logic
- Models are data structures
- Views are thin (request → service → response)

## Success Criteria

- Code compiles (Django check passes)
- Tests pass (100% pass rate)
- Coverage ≥80%
- Architecture followed
- Director approves
```

#### Methodology Application

**Agent Usage**:
- **Director**: Human orchestrated all milestones
- **Builder**: AI implemented all code + initial tests
- **Verifier**: AI validated quality, extended coverage
- **Scribe**: AI maintained documentation throughout
- **Steward**: AI reviewed phase gates

**Process Adherence**:
- Sequential workflow followed: 100% of milestones
- Quality gates enforced: 100% (no skipping)
- Documentation maintained: 100% (no lag)
- Test coverage targets: Met or exceeded on all milestones

**Rework Cycles**:
- Builder first-pass approval: 95%
- Verifier approval rate: 98%
- Average rework cycles: 0.3 per milestone (excellent)

#### Lessons Learned

**What Worked Exceptionally Well**:

1. **Sequential Validation**:
   - Multiple agent reviews caught different issue classes
   - Builder focused on correctness, Verifier on completeness, Scribe on clarity
   - Zero regressions introduced (450+ tests always passing)

2. **Documentation as Code**:
   - Documentation kept pace with implementation (0 lag)
   - Future maintainers have complete context
   - Examples tested → guaranteed accuracy

3. **Hexagonal Architecture**:
   - TUI adapter added without touching core logic
   - Credential storage swappable (filesystem → keychain)
   - Extensive test coverage possible (mock adapters)

4. **Quality Gates**:
   - Coverage targets enforced → 74.8% overall
   - Verifier caught edge cases Builder missed
   - Scribe caught documentation inaccuracies

**Challenges Overcome**:

1. **Agent Sandbox Limitations**:
   - **Issue**: Builder agent file operations didn't persist
   - **Solution**: Director manually materialized files from Builder designs
   - **Impact**: Extra 10-15 min per milestone (acceptable)

2. **Complex TUI Testing**:
   - **Issue**: TUI interactions hard to test automatically
   - **Solution**: Focused on service layer testing (>95% coverage), manual TUI validation
   - **Impact**: Lower overall coverage (74.8% vs. 80% target), but acceptable

3. **Workspace Switching Bug** (discovered late):
   - **Issue**: Workspace switching didn't persist between CLI invocations
   - **Root Cause**: In-memory cache lost, fell back to default instead of last_used
   - **Solution**: Builder fixed logic, Verifier added regression test
   - **Impact**: 2 hours to fix (caught before production)

**Adaptations Made**:

1. **Integration Test Focus**:
   - Added dedicated `tests/integration/` directory
   - End-to-end workflow tests (credential profile creation → workspace creation → ticket pull)
   - Caught issues unit tests missed

2. **Completion Reports**:
   - Added `MILESTONE-X-COMPLETE.md` for each milestone
   - Provided audit trail and evidence
   - Scribe agent created these automatically

3. **Quick Reference Guide**:
   - Created `DIRECTOR-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` after Phase 2
   - Reduced Director planning time by 50%
   - Cheat sheet for common operations

#### Success Factors

**Why This Worked**:

1. **Clear Boundaries**: Each agent knew exactly what they were responsible for
2. **Quality Focus**: No pressure to skip testing or documentation
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Framework improved after each phase
4. **Human Oversight**: Director (human) provided strategic guidance
5. **Architecture Choice**: Hexagonal pattern enabled testability

**Metrics Demonstrating Success**:

| Metric | Target | Actual | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Test Coverage | >70% | 74.8% | ✅ Exceeded |
| Regressions | 0 | 0 | ✅ Perfect |
| Documentation Lag | 0 days | 0 days | ✅ Perfect |
| Timeline Accuracy | ±20% | ±10% | ✅ Exceeded |
| Defect Density | <1/5000 LOC | 0/15000 LOC | ✅ Exceeded |
| P0 Bugs | <5 | 0 | ✅ Exceeded |

#### Recommendations for Future Projects

Based on Ticketr v3.0 experience:

**Do This**:
- ✅ Establish quality standards before Milestone 1
- ✅ Create agent prompts with project-specific patterns
- ✅ Invest in hexagonal architecture (testability ROI massive)
- ✅ Enforce sequential workflow (never skip Verifier)
- ✅ Document continuously (not after the fact)
- ✅ Create completion reports (audit trail + knowledge transfer)

**Avoid This**:
- ❌ Skipping quality gates to go faster (false economy)
- ❌ Deferring documentation (never catches up)
- ❌ Mixing presentation and business logic (untestable)
- ❌ Ignoring test coverage (debt accumulates)
- ❌ Unclear acceptance criteria (leads to scope creep)

**Adapt This**:
- Agent prompts: Customize for your language/framework
- Quality targets: Adjust coverage based on project risk
- Milestone size: 1-5 days is sweet spot (not smaller, not larger)
- Documentation hierarchy: Adapt ICD to your project structure
