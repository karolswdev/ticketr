## Post-Production

### Editing Requirements

1. **Smooth Transitions**: Use crossfades between scenes if needed
2. **Text Overlays** (optional): Brief captions explaining features
   - "Hyperspace background effect"
   - "Drop shadows on modals"
   - "Real-time progress with shimmer"
   - "Ambient effects: Optional & themeable"
3. **Speed**: Maintain real-time speed, no time-lapse or slow-motion
4. **Looping**: Ensure GIF loops seamlessly (fade out/in if needed)

### Optimization

- **Color Palette**: Reduce to 256 colors for GIF size optimization
- **Dithering**: Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering for smooth gradients
- **Frame Reduction**: If needed, reduce to 30 FPS for smaller file size
- **Compression**: Use gifsicle or similar tools to minimize file size

### Accessibility

- **Alt Text**: Provide detailed description for screen readers
- **Caption File**: Include .vtt or .srt captions describing actions
- **Static Screenshot**: Provide fallback image if GIF doesn't load

## Placeholder Content (Until GIF Recorded)

### Text Description for README

```markdown
## Visual Effects Demo

Experience Ticketr's enchanting TUI with optional visual effects:

**Subtle Motion**: Active spinners, smooth modal transitions, and focus animations bring the interface to life without distraction.

**Depth & Shadow**: Double-line focused borders, drop shadows on modals, and gradient title bars create visual hierarchy that guides your attention naturally.

**Atmospheric Effects**: Choose from themeable backgrounds‚Äîhyperspace stars streaming across dark terminals, or gentle snowfall in arctic themes. All effects are disabled by default for maximum accessibility and performance.

**Polished Details**: Success sparkles, animated progress bars with shimmer effects, and smooth transitions show craftsmanship in every interaction.

*[Marketing GIF showcasing visual effects will be added in release]*

### Static Screenshot Alternative

If GIF recording is delayed, capture 2-3 high-quality screenshots:

1. **Screenshot 1**: TUI main view with hyperspace background, focused panel with double-line border
2. **Screenshot 2**: Modal dialog with drop shadow visible
3. **Screenshot 3**: Progress bar with shimmer during async operation

### LinkedIn Post

```
Excited to share Ticketr v3.1.1‚Äîwhere CLI meets visual excellence!

We've transformed the terminal interface with:
‚Ä¢ Subtle motion that feels alive
‚Ä¢ Visual depth through shadows and gradients
‚Ä¢ Optional atmospheric effects (hyperspace stars, snowfall)
‚Ä¢ Polished details showing craftsmanship

All effects are disabled by default for accessibility, but when enabled, they create an experience that respects your time and rewards your attention.

Most CLI tools stop at "works." We went further.
