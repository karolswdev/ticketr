#### Slice 4: TUI Integration (Days 4-5) - October 19, 2025

**Multi-Select Functionality**:
- Added ticket selection with Space bar (toggle), 'a' (select all), 'A' (deselect all)
- Visual checkboxes: `[x]` for selected, `[ ]` for unselected
- Border color changes to teal/blue when tickets are selected
- Title shows selection count: "Tickets (N selected)"
- Selection state persists across panel navigation

**Bulk Operations Modal**:
- 'b' keybinding opens bulk operations menu when tickets selected
- Three operation types:
  - **Update Fields**: Change Status, Priority, Assignee, Custom Fields
  - **Move Tickets**: Move selected tickets under new parent with validation
  - **Delete Tickets**: Warning modal (not yet supported - v3.1.0 feature)

- Modified: `cmd/ticketr/tui_command.go` (service wiring)

**Verification**: Approved by Verifier (all acceptance criteria met)

### Security
- **JQL Injection Prevention**: Ticket ID format validation
  - Pattern: `^[A-Z]+-\d+$` (uppercase project key + hyphen + digits)
  - Blocks malicious input: `PROJ-1" OR 1=1`, `PROJ-1; DROP TABLE`
  - Validation occurs before any Jira API calls

- **Migration Safety**: Automatic backups during schema evolution
- **Rollback Support**: Clean rollback to pre-profile state if needed

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### BREAKING CHANGES

#### File Locations (PathResolver Integration)
**CRITICAL**: Ticketr v3.0 migrates from local project directories to platform-standard global directories following XDG Base Directory specification.

**Previous (v2.x)**:
- Database: `./.ticketr/ticketr.db` (local per-project)
- State: `./.ticketr.state` (local per-project)
- Logs: `./.ticketr/logs/` (local per-project)

**New (v3.0)**:
- **Linux**:
  - Database: `~/.local/share/ticketr/ticketr.db`
  - State: `~/.local/share/ticketr/state.json`
  - Config: `~/.config/ticketr/`
  - Logs: `~/.cache/ticketr/logs/`
- **macOS**:
  - Database: `~/Library/Application Support/ticketr/ticketr.db`
  - Config: `~/Library/Preferences/ticketr/`
  - Logs: `~/Library/Caches/ticketr/logs/`
- **Windows**:
  - Database: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ticketr\ticketr.db`
  - Config: `%APPDATA%\ticketr\`
  - Logs: `%TEMP%\ticketr\logs\`

**Migration**: Automatic on first v3.0 run. Manual commands: `migrate-paths`, `rollback-paths`.
