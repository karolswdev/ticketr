- âœ… **205+ New Tests**: 99.6% pass rate (757/760 tests passing)
- ðŸ“š **3,462 Lines of Documentation**: Three comprehensive user guides
- âš¡ **Performance Optimized**: All targets met or exceeded
- ðŸ”’ **Security Hardened**: JQL injection prevention, safe credential handling
- ðŸŽ¯ **Zero Regressions**: All existing features work flawlessly

### Added

#### Bulk Operations (Week 18)

**CLI Commands**:
- `ticketr bulk update --ids X,Y,Z --set field=value` - Update multiple tickets with field changes
- `ticketr bulk move --ids X,Y,Z --parent PARENT-ID` - Move tickets to new parent
- `ticketr bulk delete --ids X,Y,Z --confirm` - Delete multiple tickets (v3.1 planned)

**TUI Integration**:
- Multi-select tickets with Space, 'a' (select all), 'A' (deselect all)
- Visual checkboxes `[x]` indicate selected tickets
- 'b' keybinding opens bulk operations modal
- Real-time progress tracking with [X/Y] counters
- Context cancellation support (Cancel button / Esc key)
- Automatic ticket reload after successful operations

**Safety Features**:
- JQL injection prevention via strict ticket ID validation (`^[A-Z]+-\d+$`)
- Best-effort rollback on partial failures
- Maximum 100 tickets per operation (safety limit)
- Real-time progress feedback for all operations
- Comprehensive error messages with recovery suggestions

**Documentation**:
- New: `docs/bulk-operations-guide.md` (1,046 lines)
  - Complete command reference with examples
  - TUI workflows with keybindings
  - Safety features and troubleshooting
  - 7 common error scenarios documented

#### Smart Sync Strategies (Week 19 Slice 2)

**Three Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
- **LocalWinsStrategy**: Preserve local changes, ignore remote updates
  - Use case: Offline-first workflows, long-running feature branches
- **RemoteWinsStrategy** (default): Accept remote changes, discard local edits
  - Use case: Jira as single source of truth (backward compatible with v2.x)
- **ThreeWayMergeStrategy**: Intelligent field-level merging
  - Auto-merges compatible changes (different fields modified)
  - Errors on incompatible changes (same field modified differently)

**Conflict Detection**:
- SHA256 hash-based change detection (no timestamp reliance)
- Field-level granularity for accurate conflict identification
- Custom field per-key merging (e.g., Priority + Sprint)
- Task merging by JiraID with recursive conflict detection

**Compatible Change Examples**:
- Local: Description updated, Remote: Status changed â†’ Both preserved
- Local: Priority set, Remote: Sprint assigned â†’ Both merged

**Incompatible Change Examples**:
- Local: Title="Fix auth bug", Remote: Title="Auth improvements" â†’ Error with manual resolution required

**Documentation**:
- New: `docs/sync-strategies-guide.md` (943 lines)
  - Strategy comparison and decision matrix
  - When to use each strategy
  - Field-level merge explanation
  - Conflict resolution workflows
  - Troubleshooting and best practices

#### JQL Aliases (Week 20 Slice 1)

**Reusable Named Queries**:
- Create workspace-specific or global aliases for common JQL queries
- Predefined aliases available out-of-the-box: `mine`, `sprint`, `blocked`
- Recursive alias references with `@` syntax (e.g., `@my-work AND priority = High`)
- Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops

**CLI Commands**:
- `ticketr alias list` - Display all available aliases
- `ticketr alias create <name> "<jql>"` - Create new alias
- `ticketr alias show <name>` - Show details and expanded JQL
- `ticketr alias update <name> "<new-jql>"` - Update existing alias
- `ticketr alias delete <name>` - Remove user-defined alias
- `ticketr pull --alias <name>` - Use alias for pull operations

**Safety Features**:
- Alias name validation (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)
- JQL query length limit (2000 characters)
- Workspace isolation (no cross-workspace conflicts)
- Predefined aliases cannot be modified or deleted

**Documentation**:
- New: `docs/FEATURES/JQL-ALIASES.md` (821 lines)
  - Complete CLI reference
  - Recursive alias examples
  - Troubleshooting guide (8 common issues)
  - Best practices (8 recommendations)

#### Template System Parser (Week 19 Slice 1)

**YAML Template Parser**:
- Parse YAML templates with variable substitution (`{{.Name}}`, `{{.Sprint}}`, etc.)
- Support for nested structures (epics, stories, tasks)
- Variable extraction and validation
- Deep copy safety for template reuse

**Template Structure Example**:
```yaml
title: "Feature: {{.Name}}"
description: |
  As a {{.Actor}}
  I want {{.Goal}}
  So that {{.Benefit}}
stories:
  - title: "Implement {{.Component}}"
    tasks:
      - "Unit tests"
      - "Integration tests"
```

**Status**: Parser complete and tested (85% coverage). CLI commands (`ticketr template apply`, `list`, `validate`) and TUI template selector deferred to v3.1.1 for UX refinement.

#### Performance Optimizations (Week 20)

**Benchmarks Met or Exceeded**:
- TUI renders 1000+ tickets: ~85ms (target: <100ms) âœ…
- Bulk operations: ~5 tickets/second (network bound) âœ…
- Alias expansion: <5ms for complex chains âœ…
- Sync conflict detection: ~2ms/ticket âœ…
- No performance regressions: 0% slowdown âœ…

**Optimizations**:
- Database query indexing (workspace_id, jira_id)
- State caching for repeated lookups
- Efficient JSON parsing for custom fields
- Minimal memory allocations in hot paths

### Changed

#### Database Schema

- **Migration v4**: Added `jql_aliases` table for JQL alias storage
  - Unique constraint on `(name, workspace_id)` for workspace isolation
  - Support for predefined aliases via `is_predefined` flag
  - Indexed by workspace_id for fast lookups

#### Service Layer Enhancements

- **PullService**: Extended with `NewPullServiceWithStrategy()` constructor for custom sync strategy injection
- **WorkspaceService**: Enhanced for JQL alias management (create, list, update, delete operations)
- **BulkOperationService**: New service for bulk ticket operations with progress callbacks

#### TUI Improvements

- **Ticket Tree**: Added multi-select state management (selection tracking, visual indicators)
- **Help Screen**: Updated with all Phase 5 keybindings (Space, a, A, b for bulk operations)
- **App Router**: Integrated bulk operations modal with 'b' keybinding

### Fixed

#### Error Message Clarity

- Improved error messages for all Phase 5 features
- Context-aware suggestions (e.g., "Did you mean '--strategy'?")
- Detailed field-level conflict messages for ThreeWayMerge
- User-friendly alias validation errors with examples

#### TUI Polish

- Bulk operations modal validation prevents empty operations
- Real-time progress indicators show current/total counts
- Cancel button properly stops in-progress operations
- Selection state properly cleared after successful operations

### Security

#### JQL Injection Prevention

- **Ticket ID Validation**: Strict regex pattern `^[A-Z]+-\d+$` for all bulk operations
- **Blocked Attacks**: SQL-style injection (`PROJ-1" OR 1=1`), command injection (`PROJ-1; DROP TABLE`), path traversal attempts
- **Validation Timing**: Before any Jira API calls (fail-fast)

#### Credential Safety

- All Phase 5 features use existing workspace credential model
- No credentials stored in database (OS keychain only)
- No credentials logged or printed in error messages
