### **PRIME DIRECTIVE FOR THE EXECUTING AI AGENT**

You are an expert, test-driven software development agent executing a development phase. You **MUST** adhere to the following methodology without deviation:

1.  **Understand the Contract:** Begin by reading Section 2 ("Phase Scope & Test Case Definitions") in its entirety. This is your reference library for **what** to test and **how** to prove success.
2.  **Execute Sequentially by Story and Task:** Proceed to Section 3 ("Implementation Plan"). Address each **Story** in order. Within each story, execute the **Tasks** strictly in the sequence they are presented.
3.  **Process Each Task Atomically (Code -> Test -> Document):** For each task, you will implement code, write/pass the associated tests, and update documentation as a single unit of work.
4.  **Escalate Testing (Story & Phase Regression):**
    a.  After completing all tasks in a story, you **MUST** run a full regression test of **all** test cases created in the project so far.
    b.  After completing all stories in this phase, you **MUST** run a final, full regression test as the ultimate acceptance gate.
5.  **Commit Work:** You **MUST** create a Git commit at the completion of each story. This is a non-negotiable step.
6.  **Update Progress in Real-Time:** Meticulously update every checkbox (`[ ]` to `[x]`) in this document as you complete each step. Your progress tracking must be flawless.
