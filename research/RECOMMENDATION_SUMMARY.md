# Jira Library Research - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Mission:** Determine if we should use a Go library for Jira integration instead of building from scratch
**Decision:** YES - Use `andygrunwald/go-jira` v1.17.0

---

## The Answer: Use andygrunwald/go-jira

After comprehensive research, the recommendation is clear: **Replace our custom Jira adapter with `andygrunwald/go-jira`.**

### Why?

1. **You're the only user** - You don't need custom features, you need reliability
2. **We're reinventing the wheel** - The library does everything we need, better
3. **Less code to maintain** - 1,137 lines → ~200 lines (80% reduction)
4. **Better quality** - Type safety, structured errors, proven in production
5. **Low risk** - 3-4 day migration with easy rollback

## What We Evaluated

### Libraries Researched

| Library | Stars | Status | Verdict |
|---------|-------|--------|---------|
| **andygrunwald/go-jira** | 1,600+ | Stable/Maintenance | **RECOMMENDED** |
| ctreminiom/go-atlassian | 180+ | Active Development | Overkill for our needs |
| go-jira/jira | N/A | CLI tool | Not a library |

### Why andygrunwald/go-jira?

- Most battle-tested (868+ projects use it)
- Simpler than alternatives (we only need Jira, not all of Atlassian)
- Handles all our requirements (JQL, create/update, custom fields, pagination)
- MIT licensed, stable, extensible

---

## Current State Analysis

**Our Current Implementation:**
- File: `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/internal/adapters/jira/jira_adapter.go`
- Lines of Code: 1,137
- What we're doing: Manual HTTP requests, JSON parsing, pagination, error handling

**Problems:**
- Reinventing the wheel (standard HTTP/JSON operations)
- Limited type safety (map[string]interface{} everywhere)
- Generic error messages
- Maintenance burden when Jira API changes
- Missing features (OAuth, transitions, bulk operations)

**What we're doing well:**
- Progress callbacks for UX
- Workspace configuration integration
- Custom field mapping
- Acceptance criteria parsing

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Current | go-jira | Winner |
|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| JQL Search | ✓ Manual | ✓ Built-in | Library (type-safe) |
| Pagination | ✓ 50 lines | ✓ 5 lines | Library (simpler) |
| Create/Update | ✓ Manual | ✓ Type-safe | Library (safer) |
| Custom Fields | ✓ Manual map | ✓ Unknowns map | Library (flexible) |
| Error Handling | Generic | Structured | Library (better) |
| Auth Methods | Basic only | Basic + OAuth + PAT | Library (more options) |
| Code Maintenance | High | None | Library (no maintenance) |
| **Lines of Code** | **1,137** | **~200** | **Library (80% less)** |

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Implementation (Day 1-2)
1. Add go-jira dependency (✓ already done in prototype)
2. Create JiraAdapterV2 implementing JiraPort
3. Add feature flag for switching

### Phase 2: Testing (Day 3)
1. Integration tests against real Jira
2. Compare outputs with old adapter
3. Test error handling and edge cases

### Phase 3: Cutover (Day 4)
1. Switch to new adapter
2. Monitor for issues
3. Remove old code after 1 week

### Rollback Plan
- Toggle feature flag
- Restart application
- Time to rollback: < 1 minute

**Risk Level:** LOW

## Code Comparison

### Current Implementation (Simplified)
```go
// SearchTickets: ~160 lines of code
func (j *JiraAdapter) SearchTickets(...) {
    // Build JSON payload manually
    payload := map[string]interface{}{
        "jql": fullJQL,
        "fields": fields,
        "maxResults": pageSize,
    }

    // Marshal to JSON
    jsonPayload, err := json.Marshal(payload)

    // Create HTTP request manually
    req, err := http.NewRequest("POST", url, bytes.NewBuffer(jsonPayload))
    req.Header.Set("Authorization", ...)

    // Parse response manually
    var searchResult map[string]interface{}
    json.Unmarshal(body, &searchResult)

    // Extract issues manually
    issues := searchResult["issues"].([]interface{})

    // Loop, paginate, aggregate...
}
```

### With go-jira Library
```go
// SearchTickets: ~30 lines of code
func (j *JiraAdapterV2) SearchTickets(...) {
    fullJQL := fmt.Sprintf("project = %s AND %s", projectKey, jql)

    // One library call handles everything
    issues, resp, err := j.client.Issue.Search(fullJQL, &jira.SearchOptions{
        MaxResults: 100,
        Fields: []string{"summary", "description", "issuetype"},
    })

    // Type-safe conversion
    tickets := make([]domain.Ticket, len(issues))
    for i, issue := range issues {
        tickets[i] = j.convertToDomainTicket(&issue)
    }

    return tickets, nil
}
```

**Difference:**
- 160 lines → 30 lines
- map[string]interface{} → jira.Issue (type-safe)
- Generic errors → Structured errors with HTTP status
- Manual pagination → Automatic

## What We Keep

The library doesn't force us to throw everything away. We keep:

1. **JiraPort Interface** - No changes to our architecture
2. **Progress Callbacks** - Wrap library calls (~50 lines)
3. **Workspace Config** - Convert to library auth (~20 lines)
4. **Field Mapping** - Translate to library format (~50 lines)
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Our domain logic (~30 lines)

**Total custom code after migration:** ~150-200 lines (vs. 1,137 now)

---

## Prototype Validation

**Created:**
- `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/research/jira_library_prototype.go` (200 lines)
- `/home/karol/dev/private/ticktr/research/jira_adapter_v2_example.go` (362 lines)

**Tests Performed:**
- ✓ Authentication
- ✓ JQL Search
- ✓ Single issue fetch
- ✓ Project information
- ✓ Pagination
- ✓ Custom fields
- ✓ Compilation

**Result:** Library meets all requirements.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the library gets abandoned?**
A: It's stable and MIT licensed. We can fork if needed. Used by 868+ projects.

**Q: What about our progress callbacks?**
A: We keep them. Wrap library calls with progress reporting (~50 lines).

**Q: Migration risk?**
A: Low. Can rollback in < 1 minute. Prototype validates approach.

**Q: Time to migrate?**
A: 3-4 days including testing.

**Q: Why not build it better ourselves?**
A: Would take 5-7 days and still be worse (missing features, ongoing maintenance).

## The Bottom Line

**Current State:**
- 1,137 lines of HTTP/JSON boilerplate
- Limited type safety
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Missing features

**With Library:**
- ~200 lines of adapter code
- Type-safe throughout
- No maintenance (community handles it)
- More features (OAuth, transitions, etc.)

**Effort to Migrate:** 3-4 days
**Risk Level:** Low (easy rollback)
**ROI:** Immediate (better code quality, less maintenance)

---

## Recommendation

**Migrate to `andygrunwald/go-jira` in the next sprint.**

You're the only user. You don't need enterprise features. You need something that works reliably and requires minimal maintenance. The library provides exactly that.

Stop reinventing the wheel. Use the wheel. It's round. It works.
